            "title": "Towards observability of scientific applications",
            "abstract": "As software systems increase in complexity, conventional monitoring methods struggle to provide a comprehensive overview or identify performance issues, often missing unexpected problems. Observability, however, offers a holistic approach, providing methods and tools that gather and analyze detailed telemetry data to uncover hidden issues. Originally developed for cloud-native systems, modern observability is less prevalent in scientific computing, particularly in HPC clusters, due to differences in application architecture, execution environments, and technology stacks. This paper proposes and evaluates an end-to-end observability solution tailored for scientific computing in HPC environments. We address several challenges, including collection of application-level metrics, instrumentation, context propagation, and tracing. We argue that typical dashboards with charts are not sufficient for advanced observability-driven analysis of scientific applications. Consequently, we propose a different approach based on data analysis using DataFrames and a Jupyter environment. The proposed solution is implemented and evaluated on two medical scientific pipelines running on an HPC cluster.",

            "abstract": "Cloud-native is an approach to building and running scalable applications in modern cloud infrastructures, with the Kubernetes container orchestration platform being often considered as a fundamental cloud-native building block. In this paper, we evaluate alternative execution models for scientific workflows in Kubernetes. We compare the simplest job-based model, its variant with task clustering, and finally we propose a cloud-native model based on microservices comprising auto-scalable worker-pools. We implement the proposed models in the HyperFlow workflow management system, and evaluate them using a large Montage workflow on a Kubernetes cluster. The results indicate that the proposed cloud-native worker-pools execution model achieves best performance in terms of average cluster utilization, resulting in a nearly 20\\% improvement of the workflow makespan compared to the best-performing job-based model. However, better performance comes at the cost of significantly higher complexity of the implementation and maintenance. We believe that our experiments provide a valuable insight into the performance, advantages and disadvantages of alternative cloud-native execution models for scientific workflows.",

In this paper, we evaluate various machine learning techniques to predict the execution time of computational jobs. For experiments we use datasets from two application areas: scientific workflow management and data processing in the ALICE experiment at CERN. We apply a two\u2010stage prediction method and evaluate its performance. Other evaluated aspects include: (1) comparing performance of global (per\u2010workflow) versus specialized (per\u2010job) models; (2) impact of prediction granularity in the first stage of the two\u2010stage method; (3) using various feature sets, feature selection, and feature importance analysis; (4) applying symbolic regression in addition to classical regressors. Our results provide new valuable insights on using machine learning techniques to predict the runtime behavior of computational jobs.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

The notion of observability can help us cope with the complexity of such applications. We present a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) in the observability of Cloud-native applications. We have chosen 56 studies published between 2018 and 2022. The selected studies were thoroughly analyzed, compared, and classified according to the chosen comparative criteria. The presented SMS assesses engineering approaches, maturity, and efficiency of observability by deliberating around four research questions: 1) What provides the motivations for equipping Cloud-native applications with observability capabilities? 2) Which research areas are addressed in the related literature? 3) How are observability approaches implemented? 4) What are the future trends in the Cloud-native applications observability research?",

            "abstract": "Source code comprehension of massively growing code bases is the first crucial step in today\u2019s software development. One of the significant obstacles in reading the source code is understanding the code dependencies. To aid this process, we developed Graph Buddy, a tool integrated as a plugin for popular IDEs, which enables interactive visual code browsing as a graph of semantic code dependencies. To preserve the direct relation to the source code, visualize, and process only the right amount of details, we have developed Semantic Code Graph (SCG), an information model underlying Graph Buddy, capable of representing detailed code semantics. We implemented the SCG model extraction for the Scala and Java languages. To evaluate Graph Buddy, we conducted a user survey on a group of 10 programmers who used the tool in three programming-related tasks. The survey indicates that the tasks would be difficult to solve without the visual browsing tool. We believe that the proposed solution has a strong potential to enhance the way programmers comprehend code dependencies.",

To address some of these challenges and lay the groundwork for transforming workflows research and development, the WorkflowsRI and ExaWorks projects partnered to bring the international workflows community together. This paper reports on discussions and findings from two virtual \u201cWorkflows Community Summits\u201d (January and April, 2021). The overarching goals of these workshops were to develop a view of the state of the art, identify crucial research challenges in the workflows community, articulate a vision for potential community efforts, and discuss technical approaches for realizing this vision. To this end, participants identified six broad themes: FAIR computational workflows; AI workflows; exascale challenges; APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards; training and education; and building a workflows community. We summarize discussions and recommendations for each of these themes.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit: Advancing the State-of-the-art of Scientific Workflows Management Systems Research and Development",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows are a cornerstone of modern scientific computing, and they have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the last decade. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Workflows will play a crucial role in the data-oriented and post-Moore's computing landscape as they democratize the application of cutting-edge research techniques, computationally intensive methods, and use of new computing platforms. As workflows continue to be adopted by scientific projects and user communities, they are becoming more complex. Workflows are increasingly composed of tasks that perform computations such as short machine learning inference, multi-node simulations, long-running machine learning model training, amongst others, and thus increasingly rely on heterogeneous architectures that include CPUs but also GPUs and accelerators. The workflow management system (WMS) technology landscape is currently segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems that exist. Another fundamental problem is that there are conflicting theoretical bases and abstractions for a WMS. Systems that use the same underlying abstractions can likely be translated between, which is not the case for systems that use different abstractions.

            "title": "Serverless Containers \u2013 Rising Viable Approach to Scientific Workflows",
            "abstract": "The increasing popularity of the serverless computing approach has led to the emergence of new cloud infrastructures working in Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) model like AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Run, or Azure Container Instances. New infrastructures facilitate an innovative approach to running cloud containers where developers are freed from managing underlying resources. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the capabilities of elastic containers and their usefulness for scientific computing in the scientific workflow paradigm using AWS Fargate and Google Cloud Run infrastructures. For the experimental evaluation of our approach, we extended the HyperFlow engine to support these CaaS platforms, together with adapting four scientific workflows composed of several dozen to hundreds of tasks organized into a dependency graph. Studied applications are used to create cost-performance benchmarks and flow execution plots, delay, elasticity, and scalability measurements. Results show that serverless containers can be successfully utilized for running scientific workflows. Moreover, the results allow for gaining insight into the specific advantages and limits of the studied platforms.",
