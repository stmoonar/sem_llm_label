            "abstract": "Dealing with many of the problems related to the quality of textual content online involves identifying similar content. Algorithmic solutions for duplicate content classification typically rely on text vector representation, which maps textual information into a set of features. Ideally, this representation would capture all aspects of the underlying text, including length, word frequencies, syntax, and semantics. While recent advancements in text representation have led to improved performance, a comprehensive approach that explicitly incorporates all text features has not yet been proposed. In this study, we present the INCEPT framework that utilizes multiple representation methods to detect duplicate text pairs, taking advantage of their individual strengths. The core of our approach involves using a stacking ensemble of pairwise vector distance measurements that are computed from multiple text representation methods. A stacking classifier then utilizes these distance scores as input and learns to identify duplicate posts. We assess the proposed framework\u2019s effectiveness in identifying duplicate posts in an online Question and Answer platform. By combining several text representation methods, INCEPT performs well in the duplicate posts classification task. Our experiments demonstrate that specific framework configurations outperform the accuracy scores obtained from individual text representation methods. Therefore, we also infer that no single text representation method can independently capture a text\u2019s features.",

            "abstract": "The rapid explosion of linked data demands effective and efficient storage, management, and querying methods. Apache Spark is one of the most widely used engines for big data processing, with more and more systems adopting it for efficient query answering. Existing approaches, exploiting Spark for querying RDF data, adopt partitioning techniques for reducing the data that need to be accessed in order to improve efficiency. However, simplistic methods for data partitioning fail to minimize data access at query answering and effectively improve query efficiency. In this demonstration, we present DIAERESIS, a novel platform that exploits a summary-based partitioning strategy achieving a significant improvement in minimizing data access and as such improving query-answering efficiency. DIAERESIS first identifies the top-k most important schema nodes and distributes the other schema nodes to the centroid they mostly depend on. Then, it allocates the corresponding instance nodes to the schema nodes they are instantiated under, creating vertical sub-partitions and indexes. We allow conference participants to actively identify the impact of our partitioning methodology on data distribution and replication, data accessed for query answering, and query answering efficiency. Further, we contrast our approach with existing partitioning approaches adopted by state-of-the-art systems in the domain, providing a deep understanding of the challenges in the area.",

Our approach builds on the notion of counterfactual explanations in the means of a set of user-rooted edges to add or remove in the graph, in order to place the missing recommendation to the top of the recommendation list, and provides in this way actionable insights on the source data and their interrelations. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world data set demonstrates the feasibility of our proposal and reveals interesting directions for future work.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems are designed to help customers in finding their personalized content. However, biases in recommender systems can potentially exacerbate over time. Multi-objective recommender system (MORS) algorithms aim to alleviate bias while maintaining the accuracy of recommendation lists. While these algorithms effectively address item-side fairness, provider-side fairness often remains neglected. This study investigates the impact of MORS algorithms, leveraging evolutionary techniques to mitigate popularity bias on the item-side, on providers\u2019 fairness. Our findings reveal that baseline algorithms can adversely affect providers\u2019 fairness. Moreover, it is demonstrated that evolutionary algorithms, specifically those introducing less popular items to the initial population of their algorithms, exhibit superior performance compared to other MORS algorithms in enhancing providers\u2019 fairness. This research sheds light on the crucial role MORS algorithms, particularly those employing evolutionary approaches, can play in mitigating bias and promoting fairness for both users and providers in recommender systems.",

            "abstract": "Multi-domain sentiment classification trains a classifier using multiple domains and then tests the classifier on one of the domains. Importantly, no domain is assumed to have sufficient labeled data; instead, the goal is leveraging information between domains, making multi-domain sentiment classification a very realistic scenario. Typically, labeled data is costly because humans must classify it manually. In this context, we propose the MUTUAL approach that learns general and domain-specific sentence embeddings that are also context-aware due to the attention mechanism. In this work, we propose using a stacked BiLSTM-based Autoencoder with an attention mechanism to generate the two above-mentioned types of sentence embeddings. Then, using the Jensen-Shannon (JS) distance, the general sentence embeddings of the four most similar domains to the target domain are selected. The selected general sentence embeddings and the domain-specific embeddings are concatenated and fed into a dense layer for training. Evaluation results on public datasets with 16 different domains demonstrate the efficiency of our model. In addition, we propose an active learning algorithm that first applies the elliptic envelope for outlier removal to a pool of unlabeled data that the MUTUAL model then classifies. Next, the most uncertain data points are selected to be labeled based on the least confidence metric. The experiments show higher accuracy for querying 38% of the original data than random sampling.",

            "abstract": "In multi-domain sentiment classification, the classifier is trained on the source domain that includes multiple domains and is tested on the target domain. It is essential to highlight that the domain in the target domain is one of the domains in the source domain. The primary assumption is that none of the domains has sufficient labeled data, which is a real-life scenario, and there is transferred knowledge among the domains. In real applications, domains are unbalanced. Some domains have much less labeled data than others, and manually labeling them would require domain experts and much time, which can induce tremendous costs. This work proposes the REFORMIST approach that uses transfer learning and is based on Hierarchical Attention with BiLSTMs while incorporating Fast-Text word embedding. The Transfer Learning approach in this work assumes that a lot of the available data is unlabeled by only selecting a portion of the domain-specific training set. Two approaches were followed for the data sampling. In the first one, the data is randomly sampled from the data pool, while the second method applies Active Learning to query the most informative observations. First, the general classifier is trained on all domains. Second, the general model transfers knowledge to the domain-specific classifiers, using the general model's trained weights as a starting point. Three different approaches were used, and the experiments showed that the sentence-level transfer learning approach yields the best results. In this approach, the transferred weights of word-level layers are not updated throughout the training, as opposed to the weights of sentence-level layers.",

            "abstract": "This paper studies algorithmic fairness when the protected attribute is location. To handle protected attributes that are continuous, such as age or income, the standard approach is to discretize the domain into predefined groups, and compare algorithmic outcomes across groups. However, applying this idea to location raises concerns of gerrymandering and may introduce statistical bias. Prior work addresses these concerns but only for regularly spaced locations, while raising other issues, most notably its inability to discern regions that are likely to exhibit spatial unfairness. Similar to established notions of algorithmic fairness, we define spatial fairness as the statistical independence of outcomes from location. This translates into requiring that for each region of space, the distribution of outcomes is identical inside and outside the region. To allow for localized discrepancies in the distribution of outcomes, we compare how well two competing hypotheses explain the observed outcomes. The null hypothesis assumes spatial fairness, while the alternate allows different distributions inside and outside regions. Their goodness of fit is then assessed by a likelihood ratio test. If there is no significant difference in how well the two hypotheses explain the observed outcomes, we conclude that the algorithm is spatially fair.",
