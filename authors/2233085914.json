            "title": "Augmenting Textual Generation via Topology Aware Retrieval",
            "abstract": "Despite the impressive advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating text, they are often limited by the knowledge contained in the input and prone to producing inaccurate or hallucinated content. To tackle these issues, Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is employed as an effective strategy to enhance the available knowledge base and anchor the responses in reality by pulling additional texts from external databases. In real-world applications, texts are often linked through entities within a graph, such as citations in academic papers or comments in social networks. This paper exploits these topological relationships to guide the retrieval process in RAG. Specifically, we explore two kinds of topological connections: proximity-based, focusing on closely connected nodes, and role-based, which looks at nodes sharing similar subgraph structures. Our empirical research confirms their relevance to text relationships, leading us to develop a Topology-aware Retrieval-augmented Generation framework. This framework includes a retrieval module that selects texts based on their topological relationships and an aggregation module that integrates these texts into prompts to stimulate LLMs for text generation. We have curated established text-attributed networks and conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of this framework, demonstrating its potential to enhance RAG with topological awareness.",

Unlike other electronics-free tangible user interfaces which require close coupling with external hardware, Moir\u00e9Widgets can be used at greater distances while maintaining high-resolution sensing of interactions. We define a set of interaction primitives, e.g., buttons, sliders, and dials, which can be used as standalone objects or combined to build complex physical controls. These consist of 3D printed structural mechanisms with patterns printed on two layers\u2014one on paper and the other on a plastic transparency sheet\u2014which create a visual signal that amplifies subtle movements, enabling the detection of user inputs. Our technical evaluation shows that our method outperforms standard fiducial markers and maintains sub-millimeter accuracy at 100 cm distance and wide viewing angles. We demonstrate our approach by creating an audio console and indicate how our approach could extend to other domains.",

However, foraging for relevant information can become tedious and repetitive over many documents and criteria of interest. We introduce Marco, a mixed-initiative workspace supporting sensemaking over diverse business document collections. Through collection-centric assistance, Marco reduces the cognitive costs of extracting and structuring information, allowing users to prioritize comparative synthesis and decision making processes. Users interactively communicate their information needs to an AI assistant using natural language and compose schemas that provide an overview of a document collection. Findings from a usability study (n=16) demonstrate that when using Marco, users complete sensemaking tasks 16% more quickly, with less effort, and without diminishing accuracy. A design probe with seven domain experts identifies how Marco can benefit various real-world workflows.",

            "title": "PDFTriage: Question Answering over Long, Structured Documents",
            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have issues with document question answering (QA) in situations where the document is unable to fit in the small context length of an LLM. To overcome this issue, most existing works focus on retrieving the relevant context from the document, representing them as plain text. However, documents such as PDFs, web pages, and presentations are naturally structured with different pages, tables, sections, and so on. Representing such structured documents as plain text is incongruous with the user's mental model of these documents with rich structure. When a system has to query the document for context, this incongruity is brought to the fore, and seemingly trivial questions can trip up the QA system. To bridge this fundamental gap in handling structured documents, we propose an approach called PDFTriage that enables models to retrieve the context based on either structure or content. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PDFTriage-augmented models across several classes of questions where existing retrieval-augmented LLMs fail. To facilitate further research on this fundamental problem, we release our benchmark dataset consisting of 900+ human-generated questions over 80 structured documents from 10 different categories of question types for document QA.",

Interactive devices offer promise as creative tools for teachers of the visually impaired (TVIs) as they can support real-time iteration of adapted learning materials, display changing information, and provide embodied learning experiences for BLV students. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 educators (all have TVI experience) and identified their considerations when creating adaptations, attitudes towards technology, and perspectives on existing barriers to access. Our findings reveal and reaffirm unresolved challenges in the adaptation process as well as offer insights into key factors that must be considered when selecting the type of adaptation.

            "abstract": "The `pre-train, prompt, predict' paradigm of large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success in open-domain question answering (OD-QA). However, few works explore this paradigm in multi-document question answering (MD-QA), a task demanding a thorough understanding of the logical associations among the contents and structures of documents. To fill this crucial gap, we propose a Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) method to formulate the right context in prompting LLMs for MD-QA, which consists of a graph construction module and a graph traversal module. For graph construction, we create a knowledge graph (KG) over multiple documents with nodes symbolizing passages or document structures (e.g., pages/tables), and edges denoting the semantic/lexical similarity between passages or document structural relations. For graph traversal, we design an LLM-based graph traversal agent that navigates across nodes and gathers supporting passages assisting LLMs in MD-QA. The constructed graph serves as the global ruler that regulates the transitional space among passages and reduces retrieval latency. Concurrently, the graph traversal agent acts as a local navigator that gathers pertinent context to progressively approach the question and guarantee retrieval quality. Extensive experiments underscore the efficacy of KGP for MD-QA, signifying the potential of leveraging graphs in enhancing the prompt design and retrieval augmented generation for LLMs. Our code: https://github.com/YuWVandy/KG-LLM-MDQA.",

In this paper, we propose to use tropes as an intermediate representation of stories to approach story ideation. We present TaleStream, a canvas system that uses tropes as building blocks of stories while providing steerable suggestions of story ideas in the form of tropes. Our trope suggestion methods leverage data from the tvtropes.org wiki. We find that 97% of the time, trope suggestions generated by our methods provide better story ideation materials than random tropes. Our system evaluation suggests that TaleStream can support writers\u2019 creative flow and greatly facilitates story development. Tropes, as a rich lexicon of narratives with available examples, play a key role in TaleStream and hold promise for story-creation support systems.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of contract specific programming languages has struggled to translate into widespread adoption of computable contracts due largely to high conversion costs. In this work, we present the first system for converting natural language contracts into code through the extraction of key entities, relationships, and formulas into a graph representation called the Obligation Logic Graph (OLG). This approach allows the semantic meaning of contract obligations, including dependencies between obligations, to be captured through the OLG and mapped to code downstream. We also introduce OLG extraction as a new joint entity and relation prediction task for legal contracts, and present the Contract-OLG dataset, consisting of 1,876 contract provisions, 18,597 entities and 18,170 relationships. We perform detailed experiments to understand the capabilities of state-of-the-art Transformer and graph-based models at completing these tasks, and identify where there is currently a significant gap between human expert and machine performance, particularly for relation extraction.",
