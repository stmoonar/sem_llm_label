            "abstract": "Tripartite graph-based recommender systems markedly diverge from traditional models by recommending unique combinations such as user groups and item bundles. Despite their effectiveness, these systems exacerbate the longstanding cold-start problem in traditional recommender systems, because any number of user groups or item bundles can be formed among users or items. To address this issue, we introduce a Consistency and Discrepancy-based graph contrastive learning method for tripartite graph-based Recommendation. This approach leverages two novel meta-path-based metrics consistency and discrepancy to capture nuanced, implicit associations between the recommended objects and the recommendees. These metrics, indicative of high-order similarities, can be efficiently calculated with infinite graph convolutional networks layers under a multi-objective optimization framework, using the limit theory of GCN.",

            "title": "What Really Matters for Graph Contrastive Learning-Based Recommendations? A Unified Learning Strategy",
            "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has become increasingly popular in recommendation due to its remarkable ability to reduce reliance on labels. Typically, GCL employs data augmentation methods, e.g., structure perturbation and representation perturbation, and CL loss to enhance performance. Recent studies have shown that structural perturbation plays a minor role in GCL, but there is still a lack of exploration on the representation perturbation. Therefore, we compare the two data perturbations in detail and reveal that both of them have a limited impact on performance. Simply combining recommendation loss and CL loss can produce comparable improvements. Besides, we identify a shared principle between the designs of recommendation loss and CL loss: both aim to optimize representation by increasing similarity between a target node and its positive samples while decreasing similarity with negative samples. Based on these findings, we propose Compact Graph Contrastive Learning (CGCL), a streamlined strategy that eliminates the data augmentation and deeply unifies recommendation loss and CL loss by elegantly incorporating their respective contributions. Leveraging the benefits of the unified strategy, we discover that our model can learn a concentrated mode length distribution of representation, which can enhance the ability to debias and thus improve the performance of the recommendation. This is a novel perspective on representation learning, and we also validate its rationality through rigorous experiments. Our comprehensive study on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that CGCL outperforms existing GCL methods.",

            "title": "Predictive and Contrastive: Dual-Auxiliary Learning for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) recently has achieved outstanding success on recommendation. By setting up an auxiliary task (either predictive or contrastive), SSL can discover supervisory signals from the raw data without human annotation, which greatly mitigates the problem of sparse user\u2013item interactions. However, most SSL-based recommendation models rely on general-purpose auxiliary tasks, e.g., maximizing correspondence between node representations learned from the original and perturbed interaction graphs, which are explicitly irrelevant to the recommendation task. Accordingly, the rich semantics reflected by social relationships and item categories, which lie in the recommendation data-based heterogeneous graphs, are not fully exploited. To explore recommendation-specific auxiliary tasks, we first quantitatively analyze the heterogeneous interaction data and find a strong positive correlation between the interactions and the number of user\u2013item paths induced by meta-paths. Based on the finding, we design two auxiliary tasks that are tightly coupled with the target task (one is predictive and the other one is contrastive) toward connecting recommendation with the self-supervision signals hiding in the positive correlation. Finally, a model-agnostic dual-auxiliary learning (DUAL) framework, which unifies the SSL and recommendation tasks, is developed. The extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DUAL can significantly improve recommendation, reaching the state-of-the-art performance.",
