            "title": "Multi-Task Deep Recommender Systems: A Survey",
            "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) aims at learning related tasks in a unified model to achieve mutual improvement among tasks considering their shared knowledge. It is an important topic in recommendation due to the demand for multi-task prediction considering performance and efficiency. Although MTL has been well studied and developed, there is still a lack of systematic review in the recommendation community. To fill the gap, we provide a comprehensive review of existing multi-task deep recommender systems (MTDRS) in this survey. To be specific, the problem definition of MTDRS is first given, and it is compared with other related areas. Next, the development of MTDRS is depicted and the taxonomy is introduced from the task relation and methodology aspects. Specifically, the task relation is categorized into parallel, cascaded, and auxiliary with main, while the methodology is grouped into parameter sharing, optimization, and training mechanism. The survey concludes by summarizing the application and public datasets of MTDRS and highlighting the challenges and future directions of the field.",

            "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption methods provide a way to outsource computations to the cloud while protecting the confidentiality of the data. In order to deal with the large and growing data sets that are being processed nowadays, good encryption performance is an important step for practicality of homomorphic encryption methods. In this article, we study the encryption performance of the Paillier cryptosystem, a partially homomorphic cryptosystem that allows to perform sums on encrypted data without having to decrypt first. With a combination of both new and known methods, we increase the encryption performance by orders of magnitude compared to a naive implementation. The new methods reduce the bottleneck of noise calculation by using pre-computed noise to generate new noise in a much faster way than by using standard methods.",

            "abstract": "When the AAG protocol was first introduced, braid groups were proposed as platform group. However, there are studies that successful attack AAG with braid groups, one main attack method is the length-based attack. Searching for a new platform for AAG, Garber, Kahrobaei, and Lam studied polycyclic groups generated by number field and concluded that they are resistant against the length-based attack. Inspired by this result, we ask whether other type of polycyclic groups can be used as platform for AAG. In this paper, we discuss the use of Heisenberg groups, a type of polycyclic group, as a platform group for AAG by submitting them to one of AAG's major attacks, the length-based attack.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The Anshel\u2013Anshel\u2013Goldfeld (AAG) key-exchange protocol was implemented and studied with the braid groups as its underlying platform. The length-based attack, introduced by Hughes and Tannenbaum, has been used to cryptanalyze the AAG protocol in this setting. Eick and Kahrobaei suggest to use the polycyclic groups as a possible platform for the AAG protocol. In this paper, we apply several known variants of the length-based attack against the AAG protocol with the polycyclic group as the underlying platform. The experimental results show that, in these groups, the implemented variants of the length-based attack are unsuccessful in the case of polycyclic groups having high Hirsch length. This suggests that the length-based attack is insufficient to cryptanalyze the AAG protocol when implemented over this type of polycyclic groups. This implies that polycyclic groups could be a potential platform for some cryptosystems based on conjugacy search problem, such as non-commutative Diffie\u2013Hellman, El Gamal and Cramer\u2013Shoup key-exchange protocols. Moreover, we compare for the first time the success rates of the different variants of the length-based attack. These experiments show that, in these groups, the memory length-based attack introduced by Garber, Kaplan, Teicher, Tsaban and Vishne does better than the other variants proposed thus far in this context.",

The length-based attack, introduced by Hughes and Tannenbaum, has been used to extensively study AAG with the braid group as the underlying platform. Meanwhile, a new platform, using polycyclic groups, was proposed by Eick and Kahrobaei. \nIn this paper, we show that with a high enough Hirsch length, the polycyclic group as an underlying platform for AAG is resistant to the length-based attack.
