            "title": "Improved Neural Network with Spatial Pyramid Pooling and Online Datasets Preprocessing for Underwater Target Detection Based on Side Scan Sonar Imagery",
            "abstract": "Fast and high-accuracy detection of underwater targets based on side scan sonar images has great potential for marine fisheries, underwater security, marine mapping, underwater engineering and other applications. The following problems, however, must be addressed when using low-resolution side scan sonar images for underwater target detection: (1) the detection performance is limited due to the restriction on the input of multi-scale images; (2) the widely used deep learning algorithms have a low detection effect due to their complex convolution layer structures; (3) the detection performance is limited due to insufficient model complexity in training process; and (4) the number of samples is not enough because of the bad dataset preprocessing methods. To solve these problems, an improved neural network for underwater target detection\u2014which is based on side scan sonar images and fully utilizes spatial pyramid pooling and online dataset preprocessing based on the You Look Only Once version three (YOLO V3) algorithm\u2014is proposed. The methodology of the proposed approach is as follows: (1) the AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGGNet and the ResNet networks and an adopted YOLO V3 algorithm were the backbone networks. The structure of the YOLO V3 model is more mature and compact and has higher target detection accuracy and better detection efficiency than the other models; (2) spatial pyramid pooling was added at the end of the convolution layer to improve detection performance. Spatial pyramid pooling breaks the scale restrictions when inputting images to improve feature extraction because spatial pyramid pooling enables the backbone network to learn faster at high accuracy; and (3) online dataset preprocessing based on YOLO V3 with spatial pyramid pooling increases the number of samples and improves the complexity of the model to further improve detection process performance. Three-side scan imagery datasets were used for training and were tested in experiments. The quantitative evaluation using Accuracy, Recall, Precision, mAP and F1-Score metrics indicates that: for the AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGGNet and ResNet algorithms, when spatial pyramid pooling is added to their backbone networks, the average detection accuracy of the three sets of data was improved by 2%, 4%, 2% and 2%, respectively, as compared to their original formulations. Compared with the original YOLO V3 model, the proposed ODP+YOLO V3+SPP underwater target detection algorithm model has improved detection performance through the mAP qualitative evaluation index has increased by 6%, the Precision qualitative evaluation index has increased by 13%, and the detection efficiency has increased by 9.34%. These demonstrate that adding spatial pyramid pooling and online dataset preprocessing can improve the target detection accuracy of these commonly used algorithms. The proposed, improved neural network with spatial pyramid pooling and online dataset preprocessing based on the YOLO V3 method achieves the highest scores for underwater target detection results for sunken ships, fish flocks and seafloor topography, with mAP scores of 98%, 91% and 96% for the above three kinds of datasets, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) has shown its success and convenience in our daily life, especially for the application in mobile devices. Because of the high quality demand for mobile applications from the consumers, the floating point accuracy of computations especially in deep neural networks (DNNs) has become particularly important. In this paper, we focus on testing the accuracy of floating point in DNN computations in the mobile devices from a statistical point of view. Specifically, two common hypothesis testing methods Z- Test and Student's T- Test are utilized, which cope with different situations. Z- Test is suitable for samples with known population variance and T-Test is suitable for samples without known population variance. Compared to existing scheme that pays more attention on single value comparison in industry, our proposed scheme in field of probability theory is more representative and reaches a more credible results with quantitative measurement, which can be seen from our experiment that based on well-known accelerator HiAI. The most important contribution of this paper is a novel perspective to test floating point accuracy. Future work is to study how to improve the accuracy based on the results.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning has the ability to mine complex relationships in fault diagnosis. Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with deep structures, instead of shallow ones, can be applied to mining useful information from the original vibration data. However, when the number of the training samples is small, the diagnosis accuracy will be affected. As an improvement of the DCNN, deep convolutional neural network based on the Fisher-criterion (FDCNN) can be used for the fault diagnosis of small samples. But the model parameters in the method are based on human labor or prior knowledge, which is bound to bring negative influence on the diagnosis accuracy. Therefore, a novel adaptive Fisher-based deep convolutional neural network (AFDCNN) method, which can optimize the model parameters adaptively, is proposed as an improvement of the FDCNN. Comparative verification test results show that AFDCNN has more outstanding performance.",

            "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proved to be popular and successful in our daily life. For mobile devices with the services from DNN, it is needed to equip a DNN accelerator to employ fast and accurate DNN models. Different DNN accelerators may have different accuracy performance, which directly affects the user experience. To measure the accuracy of the DNN accelerators, there only exists indirect approach by comparing to the third-party platform with 32-bit float format. In this paper, metamorphic testing is employed to measure the accuracy of the DNN accelerator for the first time. Specifically, our scheme utilizes the mathematical properties of the operators in deep neural networks to measure the accuracy of the DNN accelerator, getting rid of the dependence on the third-party platform. Besides, we design an objective metric to quantitatively measure the accuracy performance. It can be used not only to facilitate the direct competition between different accelerators but also to detect defects in the implementation of the DNN accelerator. An experiment on two well-known DNN accelerators, HiAI and Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine (SNPE), is conducted, and the results show that the metamorphic distance of the former is smaller than that of the latter in terms of their accuracy performance with 16-bit float format on typical Ops, such as softmax and convolution.",
