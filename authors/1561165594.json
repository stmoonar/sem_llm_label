            "abstract": "Most current gait recognition methods suffer from poor interpretability and high computational cost. To improve interpretability, we investigate gait features in the embedding space based on Koopman operator theory. The transition matrix in this space captures complex kinematic features of gait cycles, namely the Koopman operator. The diagonal elements of the operator matrix can represent the overall motion trend, providing a physically meaningful descriptor. To reduce the computational cost of our algorithm, we use a reversible autoencoder to reduce the model size and eliminate convolutional layers to compress its depth, resulting in fewer floating-point operations. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our method reduces computational cost to 1% compared to state-of-the-art methods while achieving competitive recognition accuracy 98% on non-occlusion datasets.",

            "abstract": "Exploring and establishing artificial neural networks with electrophysiological characteristics and high computational efficiency is a popular topic that has been explored for many years in the fields of pattern recognition and computer vision. Inspired by the working mechanism of the primary visual cortex, pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNNs) can exhibit the characteristics of synchronous oscillation, refractory period, and exponential decay. These characteristics empower the PCNN model to group pixels with similar spatiality and gray values and to process digital images without training. However, electrophysiological evidence shows that the neurons exhibit highly complex nonlinear dynamics when stimulated by external periodic signals. This chaos phenomenon, also known as the \u2018butterfly effect,\u201d cannot be explained by all PCNN models. In this work, we analyze the main obstacle preventing PCNN models from imitating a real primary visual cortex. We consider neuronal excitation as a stochastic process. We then propose a novel neural network of the primary visual cortex, called a continuous-coupled neural network (CCNN). Theoretical analysis indicates that the dynamic behavior of the CCNN is distinct from the PCNN. Numerical results show that the CCNN model exhibits periodic behavior under a DC stimulus, and exhibits chaotic behavior under an AC stimulus, which is consistent with the testing results of primary visual cortex neurons. Furthermore, the image and video processing mechanisms of the CCNN model are analyzed. For image processing tasks, this model encodes the pixel intensity as the frequency of output signals so that it can group pixels with similar gray values. This image processing method can reduce the local gray level difference of the image, and compensate for small local discontinuities in the image. For video processing tasks, the CCNN encodes changing pixels as non-periodic chaotic signals, and it encodes static pixels as periodic signals. It thus achieves the purpose of moving target object recognition by distinguishing the dynamic states corresponding to different neuron clusters in the video. Experimental results on image segmentation indicate that the CCNN model has better performance than the state-of-the-art of visual cortex neural network models.",

Inspired by neuronal conduction characteristics in the primary visual cortex of cats, pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNNs) can exhibit synchronous oscillation behavior, which can process digital images without training. However, according to the study of single cells in the cat primary visual cortex, when a neuron is stimulated by an external periodic signal, the interspike-interval (ISI) distributions represent a multimodal distribution.

By analyzing the working mechanism of the PCNN, we present a novel neuron model of the primary visual cortex consisting of a continuous-coupled neural network (CCNN). Our model inherited the threshold exponential decay and synchronous pulse oscillation property of the original PCNN model, and it can exhibit chaotic behavior consistent with the testing results of cat primary visual cortex neurons. Therefore, our CCNN model is closer to real visual neural networks.

            "abstract": "Low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) plays an important role in many fields, such as machine learning, computer vision, image processing, and mathematical theory. Since rank minimization is an NP-hard problem, one strategy is that it is converted into a convex relaxation tensor nuclear norm (TNN) that requires the repeated calculation of time-consuming SVD, and the other is to convert it into some product of two smaller tensors that are easy to fall into the local minimum. In order to overcome the above shortcomings, we propose a robust tensor factorization (RTF) model for solving LRTC. In RTF, the noisy tensor data with missing entries is decomposed into low-rank tensor and noisy tensor, and then the low-rank tensor is equivalently decomposed into t-products (essentially vectors convolution) of two smaller tensors: orthogonal dictionary tensor and low-rank representation tensor. Meanwhile, the TNN of low-rank representation tensor is adopted to characterize the low-rank structure of the tensor data for preserving global information. Then, an effective iterative update algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to solve RTF. Finally, numerical experiments on image recovering and video completion tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed RTF model compared with several state-of-the-art tensor completion models.",

In this paper, a new torus-chaotic system is proposed, which has one positive Lyapunov exponent, two zero Lyapunov exponents, and two negative Lyapunov exponents. The dynamic behavior is investigated by Lyapunov exponents, bifurcations, and stability. The analysis shows that this system has an interesting route leading to chaos. Furthermore, the pseudorandom properties of output sequence are well studied and a random number generator algorithm is proposed, which has the potential of being used in several cyber security systems such as the verification code, secure QR code, and some secure communication protocols.",

Fourth-order, fifth-order, and tenth-order chaotic systems are taken as examples to verify the theory. To achieve simplicity of the electrical circuit, two back-to-back diodes represent hyperbolic sine nonlinearity without any multiplier or subcircuits.

However, traditional iris location methods often involve a large space of search, which is calculation wasting and sensitive to noise. And these methods adopt circular orientation to locate the pupillary boundary; it may lead to inaccurate location result and influence the subsequent feature extraction and recognition. To address these problems, this paper presents a precise iris location algorithm based on Vector Field Convolution (VFC, an improved Snake model) to improve the accuracy of iris location. Firstly, obtaining the iris area completely include the inside and outside boundary from an original iris image, then using minimum average grey value method to determine initialization contour of VFC model automatically, so as to locate an iris inner boundary precisely under the internal and external force of active contour. At last, we adopt the improved Daugman algorithm to locate the iris outer boundary that relatively contains little texture information. Experimental results show that the location accuracy of this method is higher, the iris inner edge location is much closer to the real boundary, the result of location have been improved significantly.",
