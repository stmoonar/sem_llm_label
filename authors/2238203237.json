            "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is crucial for personalized online services. Sample-level retrieval-based models, such as RIM, have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, they face challenges including inference inefficiency and high resource consumption due to the retrieval process, which hinder their practical application in industrial settings. To address this, we propose a universal plug-and-play \\underline{r}etrieval-\\underline{o}riented \\underline{k}nowledge (\\textbf{\\name}) framework that bypasses the real retrieval process. The framework features a knowledge base that preserves and imitates the retrieved \\&aggregated representations using a decomposition-reconstruction paradigm. Knowledge distillation and contrastive learning optimize the knowledge base, enabling the integration of retrieval-enhanced representations with various CTR models. Experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate \\name's exceptional compatibility and performance, with the neural knowledge base serving as an effective surrogate for the retrieval pool. \\name surpasses the teacher model while maintaining superior inference efficiency and demonstrates the feasibility of distilling knowledge from non-parametric methods using a parametric approach. These results highlight \\name's strong potential for real-world applications and its ability to transform retrieval-based methods into practical solutions.

            "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental technique for online advertising recommendation and the complex online competitive auction process also brings many difficulties to CTR optimization. Recent studies have shown that introducing posterior auction information contributes to the performance of CTR prediction. However, existing work doesn't fully capitalize on the benefits of auction information and overlooks the data bias brought by the auction, leading to biased and suboptimal results. To address these limitations, we propose Auction Information Enhanced Framework (AIE) for CTR prediction in online advertising, which delves into the problem of insufficient utilization of auction signals and first reveals the auction bias. Specifically, AIE introduces two pluggable modules, namely Adaptive Market-price Auxiliary Module (AM2) and Bid Calibration Module (BCM), which work collaboratively to excavate the posterior auction signals better and enhance the performance of CTR prediction. Furthermore, the two proposed modules are lightweight, model-agnostic, and friendly to inference latency. Extensive experiments are conducted on a public dataset and an industrial dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and compatibility of AIE. Besides, a one-month online A/B test in a large-scale advertising platform shows that AIE improves the base model by 5.76% and 2.44% in terms of eCPM and CTR, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Recommender models play a vital role in various industrial scenarios, while often faced with the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by the fast shifting data distribution, e.g., the evolving user interests, click signals fluctuation during sales promotions, etc. To alleviate this problem, a common approach is to reuse knowledge from the historical data. However, preserving the vast and fast-accumulating data is hard, which causes dramatic storage overhead. Memorizing old data through a parametric knowledge base is then proposed, which compresses the vast amount of raw data into model parameters. Despite the flexibility, how to improve the memorization and generalization capabilities of the parametric knowledge base is challenging. In this paper, we propose two constraints to extract Essential and Disentangled Knowledge from past data for rational and generalized recommendation enhancement, which improves the capabilities of the parametric knowledge base without increasing the size of it. The essential principle helps to compress the input into representative vectors that capture the task-relevant information and filter out the noisy information. The disentanglement principle reduces the redundancy of stored information and pushes the knowledge base to focus on capturing the disentangled invariant patterns. These two rules together promote rational compression of information for robust and generalized knowledge representations. Extensive experiments on two datasets justify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

            "title": "A Decoding Acceleration Framework for Industrial Deployable LLM-based Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "Recently, increasing attention has been paid to LLM-based recommender systems, but their deployment is still under exploration in the industry. Most deployments utilize LLMs as feature enhancers, generating augmentation knowledge in the offline stage. However, in recommendation scenarios, involving numerous users and items, even offline generation with LLMs consumes considerable time and resources. This generation inefficiency stems from the autoregressive nature of LLMs, and a promising direction for acceleration is speculative decoding, a Draft-then-Verify paradigm that increases the number of generated tokens per decoding step. In this paper, we first identify that recommendation knowledge generation is suitable for retrieval-based speculative decoding. Then, we discern two characteristics: (1) extensive items and users in RSs bring retrieval inefficiency, and (2) RSs exhibit high diversity tolerance for text generated by LLMs. Based on the above insights, we propose a Decoding Acceleration Framework for LLM-based Recommendation (dubbed DARE), with Customized Retrieval Pool to improve retrieval efficiency and Relaxed Verification to increase the acceptance rate of draft tokens, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARE achieves a 3-5x speedup and is compatible with various frameworks and backbone LLMs. DARE has also been deployed to online advertising scenarios within a large-scale commercial environment, achieving a 3.45x speedup while maintaining the downstream performance.",

            "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental technique in recommendation and advertising systems. Recent studies have shown that implementing multi-scenario recommendations contributes to strengthening information sharing and improving overall performance. However, existing multi-scenario models only consider coarse-grained explicit scenario modeling that depends on pre-defined scenario identification from manual prior rules, which is biased and sub-optimal. To address these limitations, we propose a Scenario-Aware Hierarchical Dynamic Network for Multi-Scenario Recommendations (HierRec), which perceives implicit patterns adaptively and conducts explicit and implicit scenario modeling jointly. In particular, HierRec designs a basic scenario-oriented module based on the dynamic weight to capture scenario-specific information. Then the hierarchical explicit and implicit scenario-aware modules are proposed to model hybrid-grained scenario information. The multi-head implicit modeling design contributes to perceiving distinctive patterns from different perspectives. Our experiments on two public datasets and real-world industrial applications on a mainstream online advertising platform demonstrate that our HierRec outperforms existing models significantly.",
