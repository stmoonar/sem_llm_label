            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Spatial datasets are used extensively to train machine learning (ML) models for applications such as spatial regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning. Most of the real-world spatial datasets are often too large, and many spatial ML algorithms represent the geographical region as a grid consisting of several spatial cells. If the granularity of the grid is too fine, that results in a large number of grid cells leading to long training time and high memory consumption issues during the model training. To alleviate this problem, we propose a machine learning-aware spatial data re-partitioning framework that substantially reduces the granularity of the spatial grid. Our spatial data re-partitioning approach combines fine-grained, adjacent spatial cells from a grid into coarser cells prior to training an ML model. During this re-partitioning phase, we keep the information loss within a user-defined threshold without significantly degrading the accuracy of the ML model. According to the empirical evaluation performed on several real-world datasets, the best results achieved by our spatial re-partitioning framework show that we can reduce the data volume and training time by up to 81%, while keeping the difference in prediction or classification error below 5% as compared to a model that is trained on the original input dataset, for most of the ML applications. Our re-partitioned framework also outperforms the state-of-the-art data reduction baselines by 2% to 20% w.r.t. prediction and classification errors.",

            "abstract": "Prediction of the next SQL query from the user, given her sequence of queries until the current timestep, during an ongoing interaction session of the user with the database, can help in speculative query processing and increased interactivity. While existing machine learning-- (ML) based approaches use recommender systems to suggest relevant queries to a user, there has been no exhaustive study on applying temporal predictors to predict the next user issued query. In this work, we experimentally compare ML algorithms in predicting the immediate next future query in an interaction workload, given the current user query or the sequence of queries in a user session thus far. As a part of this, we propose the adaptation of two powerful temporal predictors: (a) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and (b) a Reinforcement Learning approach called Q-Learning that uses Markov Decision Processes. We represent each query as a comprehensive set of fragment embeddings that not only captures the SQL operators, attributes, and relations but also the arithmetic comparison operators and constants that occur in the query. Our experiments on two real-world datasets show the effectiveness of temporal predictors against the baseline recommender systems in predicting the structural fragments in a query w.r.t. both quality and time. Besides showing that RNNs can be used to synthesize novel queries, we find that exact Q-Learning outperforms RNNs despite predicting the next query entirely from the historical query logs.",

GEM comprises of an efficient and lightweight blocking technique, GeoPrune, that uses the geohash encoding mechanism. We re-purpose the spatial proximality operators from Apache Sedona to create semantically rich spatial feature vectors. The classification step in GEM is a pluggable component, which consumes a unique feature vector and determines whether the geolocations match or not. We conduct experiments with three classifiers upon multiple large-scale geospatial datasets consisting of both spatial and relational attributes. GEM achieves an F-measure of 1.0 for a point x point dataset with 176k total pairs, which is 42% higher than a state-of-the-art spatial EM baseline. It achieves F-measures of 0.966 and 0.993 for the point x polygon dataset with 302M total pairs, and the polygon x polygon dataset with 16M total pairs respectively.",

The system ensures that the difference between the sample fed into the dashboard and the raw query answer never exceeds the user-specified loss threshold.

            "abstract": "Entity Matching (EM) is a core data cleaning task, aiming to identify different mentions of the same real-world entity. Active learning is one way to address the challenge of scarce labeled data in practice, by dynamically collecting the necessary examples to be labeled by an Oracle and refining the learned model (classifier) upon them. In this paper, we build a unified active learning benchmark framework for EM that allows users to easily combine different learning algorithms with applicable example selection algorithms. The goal of the framework is to enable concrete guidelines for practitioners as to what active learning combinations will work well for EM. Towards this, we perform comprehensive experiments on publicly available EM datasets from product and publication domains to evaluate active learning methods, using a variety of metrics including EM quality, #labels and example selection latencies. Our most surprising result finds that active learning with fewer labels can learn a classifier of comparable quality as supervised learning. In fact, for several of the datasets, we show that there is an active learning combination that beats the state-of-the-art supervised learning result. Our framework also includes novel optimizations that improve the quality of the learned model by roughly 9% in terms of F1-score and reduce example selection latencies by up to 10\u00d7 without affecting the quality of the model.",
