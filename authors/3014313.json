            "title": "Sustainable Grain Transportation in Ukraine Amidst War Utilizing KNARM and KnowWhereGraph",
            "abstract": "In this work, we propose a sustainable path-finding application for grain transportation during the ongoing Russian military invasion in Ukraine. This application is to build a suite of algorithms to find possible optimal paths for transporting grain that remains in Ukraine. The application uses the KNowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology(KNARM) and the KnowWhereGraph to achieve this goal. Currently, we are working towards creating an ontology that will allow for a more effective heuristic approach by incorporating the lessons learned from the KnowWhereGraph. The aim is to enhance the path-finding process and provide more accurate and efficient results. In the future, we will continue exploring and implementing new techniques that can further improve the sustainability of the path-finding applications with a knowledge graph backend for grain transportation through hazardous and adversarial environments. The code is available upon reviewer\u2019s request. It can not be made public due to the sensitive nature of the data.",

            "title": "Using temporal averaging to decouple annual and nonannual information in AVHRR NDVI time series",
            "abstract": "As regularly spaced time series imagery becomes more prevalent in the remote sensing community, monitoring these data for temporal consistency will become an increasingly important problem. Long-term trends must be identified, and it must be determined if such trends correspond to true changes in reflectance characteristics of the study area (natural), or if their source is a signal collection and/or processing artifact that can be identified and corrected in the data (artificial). Spectrally invariant targets (SITs) are typically used for sensor calibration and data consistency checks. Unfortunately, such targets are not always available in study regions. The temporal averaging technique described in this research can be used to determine the presence of artificial interannual value drift in any region possessing multiyear regularly sampled time series remotely sensed imagery. Further, this approach is objective and does not require the prior identification of a SIT within the region of study. Using biweekly Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from 1990 to 2001 covering the conterminous United States, an interannual trend present in the entire scene was identified using the proposed technique and found to correspond extremely well with interannual trends identified using two SITs within the region.",
