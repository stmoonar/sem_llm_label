            "abstract": "Understanding customer buying patterns is of great interest to the retail industry. Association rule mining is a common technique for extracting correlations such as people in the South of France buy ros\u00e9 wine or customers who buy pat\u00e9 also buy salted butter and sour bread. Unfortunately, sifting through a high number of buying patterns is not useful in practice, because of the predominance of popular products in the top rules. As a result, a number of \"interestingness\" measures (over 30) have been proposed to rank rules. However, there is no agreement on which measures are more appropriate for retail data. Moreover, since pattern mining algorithms output thousands of association rules for each product, the ability for an analyst to rely on ranking measures to identify the most interesting ones is crucial. In this paper, we develop CAPA (Comparative Analysis of PAtterns), a framework that provides analysts with the ability to compare different rule rankings. We report on how we used C A PA to compare 34 interestingness measures applied to patterns extracted from customer receipts of more than 1,800 stores for a period of one year.",

            "title": "Interactive Data-Driven Research: the place where databases and data mining research meet",
            "abstract": "Data-driven research, or the science of letting data tell us what we are looking for, is in many areas, the only viable approach to research. In some domains like adaptive clinical trials and emerging research areas such as social computing, useful results are highly dependent on the ability to observe and interactively explore large volumes of real datasets. Database management is the science of efficiently storing and retrieving data. Data mining is the science of discovering hidden correlations in data. Interactive data-driven research is a natural meeting point that presents a new research opportunity. The ability to conduct effective data-driven research requires to combine efficient indexing and querying from databases and pattern mining and classification from data mining to help analysts understand what lies behind large data volumes. In this paper, we explore key challenges and new opportunities in building robust systems for interactive data-driven research.",
