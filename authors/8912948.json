            "abstract": "Secret-key generation (SKG) at physical layer is considered as a promising solution for lightweight key distribution. On the analysis of the secret-key capacity over multipath fading channels, existing studies generally neglect the channel observation method, which has a direct impact on the secret-key capacity. Moreover, there is a lack of concise and interpretable expressions for the secret-key capacity based on the channel state information. Motivated by the above, we analyze the performance of SKG based on MMSE estimation of channel impulse response over multipath fading channels. The general expression of secret-key capacity is derived. We find that the secret-key capacity depends on the estimation signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of channel-tap gains. Then, the condensed-parameter expressions of exact secret-key capacity and the expressions of asymptotic secret-key capacity at high SNR are derived in two specific PDP cases. We show that the bandwidth and the transmission SNR determine the upper bound of secret-key capacity over channels with different degrees of freedom for the flat PDP case. In addition, we find that the asymptotic secret-key capacities under these two PDPs follow a uniform form, which is a linear function of the channel estimation SNR (in dB). Finally, we simulate the channel probing process under different transmission and channel parameters and exploit the simulated channel estimates to estimate the secret-key capacity through numerical methods. The simulation results demonstrate the theoretical analysis and conclusions.",

            "abstract": "With innovative applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ad hoc networks in various areas, their demands on broad bandwidth, large capacity and low latency become prominent. The combination of millimeter wave, directional antenna and time division multiple access techniques, which enables concurrent transmissions, is promising to deal with it. In this paper, we study the resource allocation problem in UAV ad hoc networks. Specifically, the slot assignment, antenna boresight and transmit power are jointly optimized to promote the network capacity. First, we formulate the optimization problem as the maximization of the fairness-weighted network capacity, subject to the constraint on priority guarantee. Then, because the formulated problem is a mixed integer non-linear programming problem (MINLP), which is NP-hard, two algorithms called dual-based iterative search algorithm (DISA) and sequential exhausted allocation algorithm (SEAA) are respectively proposed to efficiently solve it with acceptable complexity. DISA slacks the MINLP into a continuous-variable optimization problem and solves it with the Lagrangian dual method in an iterative manner. As a heuristic method, SEAA schedules links sequentially, i.e., from high-priority to low-priority ones. Numerical results demonstrate that both DISA and SEAA can efficiently allocate resources for UAVs, while guaranteeing the fairness and priority of links.",

            "abstract": "Recently, deep neural network (DNN)-based physical layer communication techniques have attracted considerable interest. Although their potential to enhance communication systems and superb performance have been validated by simulation experiments, little attention has been paid to the theoretical analysis. Specifically, most studies in the physical layer have tended to focus on the application of DNN models to wireless communication problems but not to theoretically understand how does a DNN work in a communication system. In this paper, we aim to quantitatively analyze why DNNs can achieve comparable performance in the physical layer comparing with traditional techniques, and also drive their cost in terms of computational complexity. To achieve this goal, we first analyze the encoding performance of a DNN-based transmitter and compare it to a traditional one. And then, we theoretically analyze the performance of DNN-based estimator and compare it with traditional estimators. Third, we investigate and validate how information is flown in a DNN-based communication system under the information theoretic concepts. Our analysis develops a concise way to open the \u201cblack box\u201d of DNNs in physical layer communication, which can be applied to support the design of DNN-based intelligent communication techniques and help to provide explainable performance assessment.",

UAV, also known as wireless aerial platforms, can be employed to improve both the network coverage and capacity. In this paper, we integrate small drone cells into a H-CRAN. However, new complications and challenges, including 3D drone deployment, user association, admission control, and power allocation, emerge. In order to address these issues, we formulate the problem by maximizing the network throughput through jointly optimizing UAV 3D positions, user association, admission control, and power allocation in H-CRAN networks. However, the formulated problem is a mixed integer nonlinear problem (MINLP), which is NP-hard. In this regard, we propose an algorithm that combines the genetic convex optimization algorithm (GCOA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach to obtain an accurate solution. Simulation results validate the feasibility of our proposed algorithm, and it outperforms the traditional genetic and K-means algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) are usually limited in computing resources and energy capacity, which means that encryption schemes with higher complexity are not suitable for them to ensure secure communication. As a promising solution to this problem, physical layer key generation suggests that shared secret keys can be generated from noisy wireless channel measurements to enhance the security of wireless communications. In this article, we propose a key generation scheme with extremely low implementation complexity, which allows physical layer key generation to be implemented on IoT nodes. First, we preprocess the channel measurements with simple moving average filtering before quantization to improve channel reciprocity. Next, a bidirectional difference quantization scheme is proposed to realize reliable quantization of channel measurements, which is ingenious in that the quantization process does not depend on quantization thresholds, and thus, the mismatched key bits caused by measurements close to quantization thresholds can be effectively avoided. Then, we propose an improved Cascade protocol to achieve lightweight and efficient information reconciliation. The simulation results show that our scheme can well balance the reliability and efficiency of key generation, and has excellent performance in terms of implementation complexity and key randomness.",

To this end, we first expound the coupling effects of computation and control to communication. Then, we propose a novel CPS framework for UAV communications. By extending the dimension of communication decisions to computation and control, the framework can precisely orient and settle the communication issues. Further, a quantitative energy optimization model is established to guide the protocol and algorithm design for UAV communications. Case simulation results validate the CPS framework in terms of the energy consumption and communication delay.",

            "title": "Joint Allocation on Communication and Computing Resources for Fog Radio Access Networks",
            "abstract": "To improve the user experience, an increasing number of mobile applications offload their computing tasks to servers with powerful computing capabilities. The fog radio access network (F-RAN) incorporates the concept of \u201cfog computing\u201d into the access network architecture, endowing an edge network with computing, storage, communication and control functions. In this paper, we consider a multiple fog access point (F-AP) and a multiuser F-RAN, where each user generates two different tasks: communication and computation. To satisfy the diverse quality of service requirements of different users, we jointly optimize the spectrum access, computation offloading and radio resource allocation. The problem is modeled as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, which is difficult to solve. In view of this, we propose a genetic algorithm based on convex optimization, i.e., the genetic convex optimization algorithm (GCOA), which divides the mixed integer nonlinear programming problem into two parts, i.e., optimization and convex optimization, to solve it in polynomial time. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.",
