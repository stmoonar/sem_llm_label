            "title": "Computational Experiments Meet Large Language Model Based Agents: A Survey and Perspective",
            "abstract": "Computational experiments have emerged as a valuable method for studying complex systems, involving the algorithmization of counterfactuals. However, accurately representing real social systems in Agent-based Modeling (ABM) is challenging due to the diverse and intricate characteristics of humans, including bounded rationality and heterogeneity. To address this limitation, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been proposed, enabling agents to possess anthropomorphic abilities such as complex reasoning and autonomous learning. These agents, known as LLM-based Agent, offer the potential to enhance the anthropomorphism lacking in ABM. Nonetheless, the absence of explicit explainability in LLMs significantly hinders their application in the social sciences. Conversely, computational experiments excel in providing causal analysis of individual behaviors and complex phenomena. Thus, combining computational experiments with LLM-based Agent holds substantial research potential. This paper aims to present a comprehensive exploration of this fusion. Primarily, it outlines the historical development of agent structures and their evolution into artificial societies, emphasizing their importance in computational experiments. Then it elucidates the advantages that computational experiments and LLM-based Agents offer each other, considering the perspectives of LLM-based Agent for computational experiments and vice versa. Finally, this paper addresses the challenges and future trends in this research domain, offering guidance for subsequent related studies.",

            "abstract": "Powered by advanced information technology, more and more complex systems are exhibiting characteristics of the cyber\u2013physical\u2013social systems (CPSS). In consideration of the cost, legal, and institutional constraints on the study of CPSS in real world, computational experiments have emerged as a new method for quantitative analysis of CPSS. However, with the increase of application scenarios, how to map complex and diverse domain models to artificial society models has become a key challenge to hinder the wide use of computational experiments. In this article, the docking framework between the domain model and the artificial society model was proposed in this article, and the model docking specification is given from three aspects: the agent model, the environmental model, and the rules model. In addition, the effectiveness of the framework was verified by two classic cases: artificial stock market and epidemic prevention and control. The result showed that the proposed model docking framework can provide technical support for the multidisciplinary applications of computational experiments and significantly reduce the difficulty of using the method.",

            "abstract": "Internet has penetrated into all aspects of social life, changed people's production and life, and brought profound effect on the traditional business model, causing unprecedented upheaval in traditional enterprise market and environment. However, current researches on the influence of Internet on the traditional business model are still lack of appropriate model and method. Therefore, how to build appropriate model, use proper method to carry out quantitative researches on the influence of Internet to the enterprise business model and whether Internet can subvert the traditional business model has become a key issue to be studied. Aiming at the problem, this paper constructs service bridge model for the quantitative analysis the change extent of Internet on different industries. According to the designed model, built the experimental system for testing the model, using computational experiment method to analyze and evaluate various aspects impact of the Internet. Manufacturing as an example for verification, the results show that service bridge model can be used to quantitative analysis different sectors; Internet has some impact on the development of manufacturing, however, it can't subvert manufacturing current business model.",
