            "title": "Using Facebook advertising data to describe the socio-economic situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon",
            "abstract": "While the fighting in the Syrian civil war has mostly stopped, an estimated 5.6 million Syrians remain living in neighboring countries1. Of these, an estimated 1.5 million are sheltering in Lebanon. Ongoing efforts by organizations such as UNHCR to support the refugee population are often ineffective in reaching those most in need. According to UNHCR's 2019 Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees Report (VASyR), only 44% of the Syrian refugee families eligible for multipurpose cash assistance were provided with help, as the others were not captured in the data. In this project, we are investigating the use of non-traditional data, derived from Facebook advertising data, for population level vulnerability assessment. In a nutshell, Facebook provides advertisers with an estimate of how many of its users match certain targeting criteria, e.g., how many Facebook users currently living in Beirut are \u201cliving abroad,\u201d aged 18\u201334, speak Arabic, and primarily use an iOS device. We evaluate the use of such audience estimates to describe the spatial variation in the socioeconomic situation of Syrian refugees across Lebanon. Using data from VASyR as ground truth, we find that iOS device usage explains 90% of the out-of-sample variance in poverty across the Lebanese governorates. However, evaluating predictions at a smaller spatial resolution also indicate limits related to sparsity, as Facebook, for privacy reasons, does not provide audience estimates for fewer than 1,000 users. Furthermore, comparing the population distribution by age and gender of Facebook users with that of the Syrian refugees from VASyR suggests an under-representation of Syrian women on the social media platform. This work adds to growing body of literature demonstrating the value of anonymous and aggregate Facebook advertising data for analysing large-scale humanitarian crises and migration events.",

            "abstract": "Conventional controllers are generally designed for a system with a known transfer function. This often requires computational modeling of the process, which can be complex, and sometimes unjustified. Adaptive and intelligent controllers have been proposed to handle uncertain or unknown systems. However, these general-purpose schemes require technical expertise for their design and implementation. This paper discusses the design of a fuzzy logic controller that drives an arbitrary process to a desired reference, and does not require expert control knowledge for implementation. The result is an operator-friendly, general-purpose fuzzy controller, coined \"common sense controller (CSC)\". Experimental verification was conducted using the graphical programming environment LabVIEWtrade",

            "abstract": "Conventional control depends on the mathematical model of the plant being controlled. When this model is uncertain, intelligent controllers, like fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs), promise better performance. FLC requires expertise knowledge of the process operation for FLC parameter setting, and the controller can be only as good as the expertise involved in the design. To make the controller less dependent on the quality of the expert knowledge, we investigate different adaptation schemes to compensate for this deficiency and propose practical adaptive fuzzy logic controllers (AFLCs). While most intelligent controller's effectiveness is proven only using simulation, we aim in this paper to compare the conventional control to FLC and AFLC experimentally. This can be achieved by constructing a hardware station comprising a plant and implementing different control algorithms for the same load conditions or disturbances.",

Moreover, fast and powerful computers, as well as reliable and implementable software packages such as LabVIEW, has considerably reduced the computational hinderances for designing, simulating and implementing sophisticated controllers. This paper presents the implementation of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy logic control of a free-standing cart-mounted inverted pendulum using LabVIEW RT. LabVIEW Real Time (RT) is the reliable stand-alone hardware control processor and Windows independent software. The proposed algorithm shows high capabilities in learning. We show that this algorithm can be effectively applied to fast regulation of the new proposed inverted pendulum setup subjected to large disturbances or uncertainties. The experimental implementation of the algorithm on the freestanding cart-mounted inverted pendulum evaluates the effectiveness and results of the proposed algorithm and its comparative results with similar intelligent adaptive intelligent controllers.",

The implemented adaptive technique predicts tracking-error divergence and makes online adjustments to the controller gain parameters in order to obtain a faster regulation of the error signal. The proposed PSS is less sensitive to the quality of expert knowledge, and thus is more robust than a non-adaptive fuzzy PSS when subjected to large disturbances. Hence, adequate controls are derived for the various error cases, and smooth control surfaces are achieved. Simulations are carried out using the proposed PSS to show that it consistently gives a stable response with acceptable overshoots and settling times on the frequency, angle and voltage errors.",

            "abstract": "Expensive hardware that has been purchased in the past by educational institutions can be re-utilized and modernized to take advantage of newly introduced technologies. Keeping in mind that the introduction of these tools is an educational experience by itself. Robots are defined as flexible, reprogrammable automated machines. This paper addresses the problems with the RHINO educational robot original software interface that limited the RHINO to an almost rigid mechanism. A new software interface, based on a popular high-level structured language, is introduced which will make the RHINO robot a better teaching tool. Since the RHINO robot has been popular in robotics teaching worldwide, it will become helpful in robotics lectures and demonstrations where students can implement various concepts on the RHINO robot. Specifically, the inverse kinematics problem is solved for the robot at hand and used in an experiment to calculate online the needed position and orientation of the end effector. This important capability was not possible with the commercial original interface of the RHINO. Other advantages of the newly introduced interface (such as clock, real numbers, and software library units) open the way for more educational benefits of the RHINO in robotics, digital control, engineering projects and research. The outline of four experiments being conducted in the Robotics course being offered at the American University of Beirut based on the result of this paper is presented. In addition, the same robot has been effectively utilized in final year projects for graduating engineers of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.",
