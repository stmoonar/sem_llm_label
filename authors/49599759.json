            "title": "A Data-Distillation-Enhanced Autoencoder for Detecting Anomalous Gas Consumption",
            "abstract": "The number of natural gas users has been growing rapidly in China due to the promotion of clean energy and the economic benefits of natural gas, especially in businesses and industries. Though the infrastructures for gas supplies have been highly improved, gas providers are still suffering from various problems, such as malfunctioning gas meters, gas leakage, gas theft, etc. With the development of the Internet of Things, smart gas meters have been widely adopted by gas providers to collect real-time gas consumption data for billing purposes which can also serve as a basis for anomaly detection. One challenge of using such data for anomaly detection is that it is difficult to obtain sufficient labeled data for model training. To address this challenge, we propose D2AE, a data-distillation-enhanced autoencoder for detecting anomalous gas consumption, which consists of three modules. The first module preprocesses the raw meter readings and carries out a rule-based anomaly detection. The second module extracts the normal gas usage patterns via an integration of correlation and clustering-based consistency evaluation methods. The extracted normal usage patterns are then used in the third module to train an autoencoder for anomaly detection. D2AE intends to provide a method to detect anomalous gas consumption induced by various causes such that manual inspection can be largely reduced. Moreover, D2AE does not require user-specific information and can be applied to different types of gas users. Based on a real-world gas consumption data set, we carry out a set of experiments and show that D2AE outperforms the existing anomaly detection methods in the literature and improves the $F_{1}$ score by an average of 7.4% for restaurant users and 5.7% for canteen users.",

            "abstract": "Modern vehicles have become typical consumer electronics with the development of sensing, transmission, and computation technologies. The emerging intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) yield lots of deep neural network (DNN) based tasks, requiring intensive computation. In view of this, this paper makes the first exploration of accelerating the processing of DNN-based tasks while maintaining decent system reliability in vehicular edge computing (VEC) via task partitioning and offloading. Specifically, we present a specific scenario, where vehicles partition and offload their tasks to nearby vehicles and roadside infrastructures, while they may fail to receive results due to unstable vehicular communications. Then, we model the task delay by considering task properties and node capacities. On this basis, the Partitioning and Offloading Problem (POP) is formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem, to maximize both the acceleration ratio and service ratio of DNN-based tasks in VEC. Further, we propose a Distributed Partitioning and Offloading Solution (DPOS), where a delay-priority-oriented offloading strategy is designed to help edge nodes make offloading decisions, and a stacking-based partitioning strategy is designed to assist client vehicles to make partitioning decisions. Finally, we give a comprehensive performance evaluation, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed solution.",

            "abstract": "Vehicle position prediction (VPP) is of great significance for navigation planning and traffic safety of intelligent vehicles. In general, particle filtering (PF) uses global navigation satellite system (GNSS) to implement VPP. However, it does not consider geographic layer information (GLI) and its particle weight is not combined with the real-world geographic position information, which leads to insufficient prediction preparation. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel PF-based VPP method by using three-dimensional convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (3D CNN-LSTM) network model. First, for data preprocessing, we extract kinematic information features from GNSS, and evenly divide the area around each GNSS point into multiple grids and calculate the probability of grids center belonging to each GLI type. In addition, in order to better reflect the relationship between two consecutive positions due to the factors such as the conversion angle, we construct tilted cells to represent possible positions of each vehicle at any time. Second, a novel 3D CNN-LSTM model is designed to calculate the vehicle occurrence probability (VOP) in each tilted cell by processing the GLI and GNSS data, which can optimize the PF weight of each particle, and then improve PF to make more precise position prediction. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed VPP method can improve the cell prediction accuracy, and then significantly improve the position prediction precision.",

            "abstract": "Automatic text spotting can help unmanned vehicles read human texts, thus improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving. Some existing text spotting models use inefficient region proposal networks or modules based on the recurrent neural network. Region proposal networks produce redundant anchors. Recurrent neural networks cannot perform parallel operations well. The existence of these inefficient modules prevents these models from applying in autonomous unmanned vehicles. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end two-stage text spotting model named Center TextSpotter, which is a convolution model that does not involve region proposal networks and recurrent neural network. Moreover, we develop a weakly supervised training method and a feature fusion module. The weakly supervised training method adjusts the loss by weighting the predicted labels to improve the performance of text recognition. The feature fusion module fuses the features of the proposal with the features of the proposal-context to enhance the overall performance. Our model follows the modular design principle. So it can be easily extended and modified. This paper presents an extension scheme based on graph neural network. By adding the graph neural network before the fully connected layer, the model learns better features. Experiments demonstrate that Center TextSpotter can complete the task of text spotting for autonomous unmanned vehicles commendably.",

            "abstract": "LoRa has emerged as a novel Internet of Things (IoT) communication paradigm, featuring with long-range and low-power transmission capabilities. With the widespread deployment of LoRa networks, the demand to perform Firmware Update Over-The-Air (FUOTA) tasks has become increasingly critical for unattended LoRa devices. However, in practice, three fundamental problems that hinder the performance of FUOTA tasks are revealed, including low energy efficiency, poor transmission reliability, and biased multicast grouping. In this demo, we present a novel FUOTA system, the first work that offers an effective and sustainable solution to achieve energy-efficient and reliable over-the-air firmware updates in LoRa networks. In particular, this system incorporates threefold key modules: delta scripting, channel coding, and beamforming. The delta scripting algorithm unlocks the capability of incremental update, the channel coding scheme ensures the reliability and robustness of large-scale firmware image distribution, and the beamforming strategy as an optional module can further serve the unicast user. Thus, this demo presents a working example of functionality customization to show the efficacy and feasibility of our FUOTA system in LoRa networks.",

            "abstract": "In order to ensure the efficiency of power user\u2019s requirements processing, an automatic classification method for demand test of power users based on parallel naive Bayesian algorithm is proposed. Polynomial naive Bayes is selected to build Hadoop cluster, and the feature words of power user\u2019s requirements are selected through chi square test. The weight of each feature item is calculated by word frequency-inverse text frequency index method, and the weight sum of each category is calculated. The weight sum is input into naive Bayes algorithm to output the text classification results of power user\u2019s requirements. At the same time, The naive Bayes classification algorithm is parallelized and encapsulated to reduce the cost of data movement and exchange in the classification process, and improve the operation efficiency of demand text classification of power user. The experimental results show that this method can accurately extract the feature words of power user\u2019s requirements, effectively realize the automatic classification of power user\u2019s requirements text, and have a more accurate classification effect. The average fitness value of the proposed method tends to be stable after more than 20 training times, and the number of network convergence steps is 7. When the ratio of energy function is about 0.4 and 0.6, the average IU value is the highest. When the required number of texts ranges from 500 to 1500, the delay time of text classification is 0.02\u200as, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio is more than 33, among which the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio is 42.52, and the normalization coefficient is 1.",

            "abstract": "LoRa has emerged as one of the promising long-range and low-power wireless communication technologies for Internet of Things (IoT). With the massive deployment of LoRa networks, the ability to perform Firmware Update Over-The-Air (FUOTA) is becoming a necessity for unattended LoRa devices. LoRa Alliance has recently dedicated the specification for FUOTA, but the existing solution has several drawbacks, such as low energy efficiency, poor transmission reliability, and biased multicast grouping. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient, reliable, and beamforming-assisted FUOTA system for LoRa networks named FLoRa, which is featured with several techniques, including delta scripting, channel coding, and beamforming. In particular, we first propose a novel joint differencing and compression algorithm to generate the delta script for processing gain, which unlocks the potential of incremental FUOTA in LoRa networks. Afterward, we design a concatenated channel coding scheme to enable reliable transmission against dynamic link quality. The proposed scheme uses a rateless code as outer code and an error detection code as inner code to achieve coding gain. Finally, we design a beamforming strategy to avoid biased multicast and compromised throughput for power gain. Experimental results on a 20-node testbed demonstrate that FLoRa improves network transmission reliability by up to 1.51 \u00d7 and energy efficiency by up to 2.65 \u00d7 compared with the existing solution in LoRaWAN.",

            "abstract": "A graph neural network (GNN) is a powerful architecture for semi-supervised learning (SSL). However, the data-driven mode of GNNs raises some challenging problems. In particular, these models suffer from the limitations of incomplete attribute learning, insufficient structure capture, and the inability to distinguish between node attribute and graph structure, especially on label-scarce or attribute-missing data. In this article, we propose a novel framework, called graph coneighbor neural network (GCoNN), for node classification.

GCoNN tends to convergence iteratively using such an approach. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze this iteration process from a generalized expectation\u2013maximization (GEM) framework perspective which optimizes an evidence lower bound (ELBO) by amortized variational inference. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach outperforms other methods. We also apply GCoNN to brain functional networks, the results of which reveal response features across the brain which are physiologically plausible with respect to known language and visual functions.",

            "title": "The effect of elastic backboards on kinematic and neuromuscular parameters in Para-alpine sit skiers with severe disabilities",
            "abstract": "Alpine sit skiing is a Winter Paralympic event, in which para-athletes ski sitting on a sit-ski due to physical impairments. Since assistive devices and trunk function play an important role in sit skiers, this single-subject study aims to estimate the effect of elastic backboards on the kinematic and trunk neuromuscular parameters of para-alpine sit skiers. A set of trunk function testing devices and a markerless OpenPose motion tracking system were developed. An experiment, including six different trunk exercises in a sitting position, was conducted on the test board for four para-alpine sit skiers with severe disabilities (LW10-1, LW10-2 \u00d7 2, LW11). The controlled experimental condition was whether there was an elastic backboard. The following parameters were recorded and calculated, including joint angular positions, and surface electromyography of trunk muscles (RA, rectus abdominis; EO, external oblique; ES, erector spinae). The multi-joint coordination of the subjects during sitting lateral flexion (SLF) exercises was extracted using a principal component analysis of the joint angles. The results showed that after adding the elastic backboard, the maximal test board inclination angles, the trunk forward flexion angles and the backward extension angles increased by 48.31%, 156.15% and 76.01% respectively. Mean peak activation of EO and ES showed an overall decrease of 23.06% and 28.56% across six exercises. Multi-joint coordination and a weight shift from the upper extremity compensation to hip joints (+46.56%) after adding the elastic backboard were found in the SLF exercise. The above results illustrated the positive influence of the elastic backboard on the kinematic and neuromuscular performance of sit skiers. The findings can support the optimized design of sit-skis and assistive devices in general, and facilitate the application of markerless motion-tracking systems in medical measurements and sports biomechanics.",

            "abstract": "We study a class of non-convex and non-smooth problems with \\textit{rank} regularization to promote sparsity in optimal solution. We propose to apply the proximal gradient descent method to solve the problem and accelerate the process with a novel support set projection operation on the singular values of the intermediate update. We show that our algorithms are able to achieve a convergence rate of $O(\\frac{1}{t^2})$, which is exactly same as Nesterov's optimal convergence rate for first-order methods on smooth and convex problems. Strict sparsity can be expected and the support set of singular values during each update is monotonically shrinking, which to our best knowledge, is novel in momentum-based algorithms.",
