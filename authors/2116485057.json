            "abstract": "Semantic communication has shown great potential in efficiently accomplishing intelligent tasks. However, existing systems usually make a single-view decision in a deterministic manner while ignoring the intrinsic semantic noise caused by ambiguity. This may result in the misunderstanding during the exchange of semantic information. In this letter, we propose a novel probabilistic uncertainty coding (PUC) architecture to achieve versatile multi-view semantic communications with multiple outputs. Specifically, each feature region is characterized as a Gaussian distribution whose variance represents semantic uncertainty. Then, we leverage the Gaussian information bottleneck theory to jointly optimize the rate-distortion tradeoff between the semantic informativeness and inference performance. Moreover, we provide a semantic similarity metric to evaluate the accuracy of multi-view semantic communication. Considering the cross-modal task of semantic knowledge transfer, simulation results show that PUC outperforms conventional deterministic method and traditional separate transmissions. Due to its semantic-aware capability, the proposed PUC can make diverse yet plausible predictions in a highly reliable and low-latency manner.",

            "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has largely extended the border and capacity of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) by providing a key element for enabling flexible distributed data inputs, computing capacity, and high mobility. To enhance data privacy for AIoT applications, federated learning (FL) is becoming a potential solution to perform training tasks locally on distributed IoT devices. However, with the limited onboard resources and battery capacity of each UAV node, optimization is required to achieve a large-scale and high-precision FL scheme. In this work, an optimized multi-UAV-assisted FL framework is designed, where regular IoT devices are in charge of performing training tasks, and multiple UAVs are leveraged to execute local and global aggregation tasks. An online resource allocation (ORA) algorithm is proposed to minimize the training latency by jointly deciding the selection decisions of clients and a global aggregation server. By leveraging the Lyapunov optimization technique, virtual energy queues are studied to depict the energy deficit. With the help of the actor-critic learning framework, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme is designed to improve per-round training performance. A deep neural network (DNN)-based actor module is designed to derive client selection decisions, and a critic module is proposed through a conventional optimization method to evaluate the obtained selection decisions. Moreover, a greedy scheme is developed to find the optimal global aggregation server. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ORA algorithm can achieve optimal training latency and energy consumption under various system settings.",

            "abstract": "Adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning (RL) can continuously improve their adaptability to network conditions. Existing methods usually adopt a reward function to train the ABR policies. However, in some network conditions, the quality of experience (QoE) performances obtained from the deterministic reward functions are not consistent with the users' perception. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based deep reward model from video trajectory preference data to obtain a dynamic reward function that better reflects users' preference of the video stream. To augment the training data with more precise aggregation in a quick way, we leverage the digital twin (DT) technology to map the users' trajectory into virtual space. The digital twin can mimic users' video trajectory preferences which is used to train a reward model that can precisely predict QoE. Integrated with this reward model, the RL algorithm can generate an ABR policy that optimizes the user-perceived QoE. Experiment results show that the accuracy of the proposed reward model outperforms state-of-the-art reward functions by 13.6% in preference prediction. Compared with other RL-based ABR policies, our RL-based trajectory-preferred ABR algorithm can increase the average user QoE by 16.4%.",

            "abstract": "Considering the infrastructure deployment cost and energy consumption, it is unrealistic to provide seamless coverage of the vehicular network. The presence of uncovered areas tends to hinder the prevalence of the in-vehicle services with large data volume. To this end, we propose a predictive cooperative multi-relay transmission strategy (PreCMTS) for the intermittently connected vehicular networks, fulfilling the 6G vision of semantic and green communications. Specifically, we introduce a task-driven knowledge graph (KG)-assisted semantic communication system, and model the KG into a weighted directed graph from the viewpoint of transmission. Meanwhile, we identify three predictable parameters about the individual vehicles to perform the following anticipatory analysis. Firstly, to facilitate semantic extraction, we derive the closed-form expression of the achievable throughput within the delay requirement. Then, for the extracted semantic representation, we formulate the mutually coupled problems of semantic unit assignment and predictive relay selection as a combinatorial optimization problem, to jointly optimize the energy efficiency and semantic transmission reliability. To find a favorable solution within limited time, we proposed a low-complexity algorithm based on Markov approximation. The promising performance gains of the PreCMTS are demonstrated by the simulations with realistic vehicle traces generated by the SUMO traffic simulator.",

            "abstract": "In order to cope with the fluctuation of network bandwidth and provide smooth video services, adaptive video streaming technology is proposed. In particular, the adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithm is widely used in dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) to improve quality of experience (QoE). However, existing ABR algorithms still ignore the inherent visual sensitivity of human visual system (HVS). As the final receiver of video, HVS has different sensitivity to the quality distortion of different video content, and video content with high visual sensitivity needs to allocate more bitrate resources. Therefore, existing ABR algorithms still have limitations in reasonably allocating bitrate and maximizing QoE. To solve this problem, this paper designs an adaptive bitrate strategy from the perspective of user vision, studies the modeling of visual sensitivity, and proposes a visual sensitivity aware ABR algorithm. We extract a set of content features and attribute features from the video, and consider the simulation of HVS to establish a total masking effect model that reflects the visual sensitivity more accurately. Further, the network status, buffer occupancy, and visual sensitivity are comprehensively considered under a deep reinforcement learning framework to select the appropriate bitrate for maximizing QoE. We implement the proposed algorithm over a realistic trace-driven evaluation and compare its performance with several latest algorithms. Experimental results show that our algorithm can align ABR strategy with visual sensitivity to achieve better QoE in high visual sensitivity content, and improves the average perceptual video quality and overall user QoE by 18.3% and 22.8%, respectively. Additionally, we prove the feasibility of our algorithm through subjective evaluation in the real environment.",

            "abstract": "Vehicular Metaverses are widely considered as the next Internet revolution to build a 3D virtual world with immersive virtual-real interaction for passengers and drivers. In vehicular Metaverse applications, avatars are digital representations of on-board users to obtain and manage immersive vehicular services (i.e., avatar tasks) in Metaverses and the data they generate. However, traditional Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data management solutions have serious data security risks and privacy protection. Fortunately, blockchain-based Web 3.0 enables avatars to have an ownership identity to securely manage the data owned by users in a decentralized and transparent manner. To ensure users\u2019 immersive experiences and securely manage their data, avatar tasks often require significant computing resources. Therefore, it is impractical for the vehicles to process avatar tasks locally, massive computation resources are needed to support the avatar tasks. To this end, offloading avatar tasks to nearby RoadSide Units (RSUs) is a promising solution to avoid computation overload. To ensure real-time and continuous Metaverse services, the avatar tasks should be migrated among the RSUs when the vehicle navigation. It is challenging for the vehicles to independently decide whether migrate or not according to current and future avatar states. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new avatar task migration framework for vehicular Metaverses. We then formulate the avatar task migration problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and apply a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) algorithm to dynamically make migration decisions for avatar tasks. Numerous results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing baselines for avatar task migration and enables immersive vehicular Metaverse services.",

            "abstract": "Most providers of video streaming are interested in improving quality of user experience across various wireless network circumstances. Many buffer-based ABR algorithms have been proposed to adjust the bitrate according to the buffer occupancy at the client player. Though keeping the buffer occupancy stable, such ABR algorithms cannot provide satisfied responsiveness to bandwidth dynamics. To solve the problem, we propose an ABR algorithm BBA+ that iteratively corrects the mapping function between bitrate and buffer occupancy according to network throughput. The results show that BBA+ effectively improves the average bitrate and reduces the rebuffering ratio.",

            "title": "AIS Data-Based Efficient Ship Trajectory Clustering",
            "abstract": "High-quality ship trajectory clustering is an important fundament for learning meaningful knowledge from massive historical trajectories, which are commonly extracted from the shipborne Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. However, clustering of massive trajectory data easily suffers from two limitations, i.e., low accuracy and high computational cost. In this work, we propose to develop an efficient ship trajectory clustering method based on the virtual maritime traffic network, which is constructed using the massive AIS data. In particular, we first adopt the popular Douglas-Peucker (DP) algorithm to simplify the ship trajectories to obtain the first type of feature points, where the moving ships change the course significantly. The second type of features points, where exist the large number of ship encounters, is also obtained through estimating the ship density map. The density-based clustering method is employed to remove the unwanted outliers in these feature points, contributing to the extraction of important waypoints. The virtual maritime traffic network is then constructed using the extracted way-points. To obviously shorten the computational cost, the virtual network is finally used to cluster the massive ship trajectories by introducing the concepts of base cluster and stream cluster. Two famous metrics, i.e., Silhouette Coefficient (SC) and Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI), will be exploited to evaluate the trajectory clustering results for our method and several competing methods. Experimental results on realistic AIS data have demonstrated the superior clustering performance of our method in terms of computational efficiency, SC and DBI metrics.",
