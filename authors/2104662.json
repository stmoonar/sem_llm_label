            "abstract": "State-of-the-art face recognition systems require vast amounts of labeled training data. Given the priority of privacy in face recognition applications, the data is limited to celebrity web crawls, which have issues such as limited numbers of identities. On the other hand, self-supervised revolution in the industry motivates research on the adaptation of related techniques to facial recognition. One of the most popular practical tricks is to augment the dataset by the samples drawn from generative models while preserving the identity. We show that a simple approach based on fine-tuning pSp encoder for StyleGAN allows to improve upon the state-of-the-art facial recognition and performs better compared to training on synthetic face identities. We also collect large-scale unlabeled datasets with controllable ethnic constitution \u2013 AfricanFaceSet-5M (5 million images of different people) and AsianFaceSet-3M (3 million images of different people) \u2013 and we show that pretraining on each of them improves recognition of the respective ethnicities (as well as others), while combining all unlabeled datasets results in the biggest performance increase. Our self-supervised strategy is the most useful with limited amounts of labeled training data, which can be beneficial for more tailored face recognition tasks and when facing privacy concerns. Evaluation is based on a standard RFW dataset and a new large-scale RB-WebFace benchmark. The code and data are made publicly available at https://github.com/seva100/stylegan-for-facerec.",

            "abstract": "Social networks, such as Twitter, form a heterogeneous information network (HIN) where nodes represent domain entities (e.g., user, content, advertiser, etc.) and edges represent one of many entity interactions (e.g, a user re-sharing content or \"following\" another). Interactions from multiple relation types can encode valuable information about social network entities not fully captured by a single relation; for instance, a user's preference for accounts to follow may depend on both user-content engagement interactions and the other users they follow. In this work, we investigate knowledge-graph embeddings for entities in the Twitter HIN (TwHIN); we show that these pretrained representations yield significant offline and online improvement for a diverse range of downstream recommendation and classification tasks: personalized ads rankings, account follow-recommendation, offensive content detection, and search ranking. We discuss design choices and practical challenges of deploying industry-scale HIN embeddings, including compressing them to reduce end-to-end model latency and handling parameter drift across versions.",

Most existing PLMs are not tailored to the noisy user-generated text on social media, and the pre-training does not factor in the valuable social engagement logs available in a social network. We present TwHIN-BERT, a multilingual language model productionized at Twitter, trained on in-domain data from the popular social network. TwHIN-BERT differs from prior pre-trained language models as it is trained with not only text-based self-supervision but also with a social objective based on the rich social engagements within a Twitter heterogeneous information network (TwHIN). Our model is trained on 7 billion tweets covering over 100 distinct languages, providing a valuable representation to model short, noisy, user-generated text. We evaluate our model on various multilingual social recommendation and semantic understanding tasks and demonstrate significant metric improvement over established pre-trained language models. We open-source TwHIN-BERT and our curated hashtag prediction and social engagement benchmark datasets to the research community.",

            "abstract": "We present two novel solutions for multi-view 3D human pose estimation based on new learnable triangulation methods that combine 3D information from multiple 2D views. The first (baseline) solution is a basic differentiable algebraic triangulation with an addition of confidence weights estimated from the input images. The second, more complex, solution is based on volumetric aggregation of 2D feature maps from the 2D backbone followed by refinement via 3D convolutions that produce final 3D joint heatmaps. Crucially, both of the approaches are end-to-end differentiable, which allows us to directly optimize the target metric. We demonstrate transferability of the solutions across datasets and considerably improve the multi-view state of the art on the Human3.6M dataset.",

Our system takes the middle path between the classical graphics pipeline and the recent deep learning approaches that generate images of humans using image-to-image translation. In particular, our system estimates an explicit two-dimensional texture map of the model surface. At the same time, it abstains from explicit shape modeling in 3D. Instead, at test time, the system uses a fully-convolutional network to directly map the configuration of body feature points w.r.t. the camera to the 2D texture coordinates of individual pixels in the image frame. We show that such system is capable of learning to generate realistic renderings while being trained on videos annotated with 3D poses and foreground masks. We also demonstrate that maintaining an explicit texture representation helps our system to achieve better generalization compared to systems that use direct image-to-image translation.",

            "abstract": "We present a new approach for the approximate K-nearest neighbor search based on navigable small world graphs with controllable hierarchy (Hierarchical NSW, HNSW). The proposed solution is fully graph-based, without any need for additional search structures (typically used at the coarse search stage of the most proximity graph techniques). Hierarchical NSW incrementally builds a multi-layer structure consisting of a hierarchical set of proximity graphs (layers) for nested subsets of the stored elements. The maximum layer in which an element is present is selected randomly with an exponentially decaying probability distribution. This allows producing graphs similar to the previously studied Navigable Small World (NSW) structures while additionally having the links separated by their characteristic distance scales. Starting the search from the upper layer together with utilizing the scale separation boosts the performance compared to NSW and allows a logarithmic complexity scaling. Additional employment of a heuristic for selecting proximity graph neighbors significantly increases performance at high recall and in case of highly clustered data. Performance evaluation has demonstrated that the proposed general metric space search index is able to strongly outperform previous opensource state-of-the-art vector-only approaches. Similarity of the algorithm to the skip list structure allows straightforward balanced distributed implementation.",

            "abstract": "Retrieval pipelines commonly rely on a term-based search to obtain candidate records, which are subsequently re-ranked. Some candidates are missed by this approach, e.g., due to a vocabulary mismatch. We address this issue by replacing the term-based search with a generic k-NN retrieval algorithm, where a similarity function can take into account subtle term associations. While an exact brute-force k-NN search using this similarity function is slow, we demonstrate that an approximate algorithm can be nearly two orders of magnitude faster at the expense of only a small loss in accuracy. A retrieval pipeline using an approximate k-NN search can be more effective and efficient than the term-based pipeline. This opens up new possibilities for designing effective retrieval pipelines. Our software (including data-generating code) and derivative data based on the Stack Overflow collection is available online.",
