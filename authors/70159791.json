            "title": "Image Reconstruction Using Variable Exponential Function Regularization for Wide-Field Polarization Modulation Imaging",
            "abstract": "Polarization modulation imaging technology plays an important role in microscopic super-resolution imaging. However, the specimen medium contains retardancy, while charge-coupled devices may provide discrete under-sampling, and the coupled wavefronts consisting of the polarization state of the light and the anisotropic distribution of the specimen can lead to vectorial phase fitting degradation. Considering that the point spread function (PSF) of the main degradation parts can be regarded as an asymmetric generalized Gaussian distribution with uncertain parameters, an adaptive image reconstruction method is proposed based on variable exponential function regularization. The proposed method concentrates on the diversity of the PSF and uses a variable exponent regularization to improve flexibility of the kernel. Moreover, it can balance image edge preservation and provide staircase artifact suppression, which reduces the over- and under-reconstruction of the microscopic images effectively. By optimizing the Split\u2013Bregman algorithm, we create an efficient method that minimizes the iterative loss function under the premise of achieving high estimation accuracy. Compared with other methods, the experimental results reveal better effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, with improvements of 18% in the peak signal-to-noise ratio, 21% in the structural similarity index measurement, and 337% in the mean structural similarity index measurement.",

            "abstract": "This paper proposes an efficient fusion method for multiple remote sensing images based on sparse representation, in which we mainly solve the fusion rules of the sparse coefficients. In the proposed fusion method, first is to obtain the sparse coefficients of different source images based on three dictionaries. Considering the sparsity, the source coefficients can be divided into large, middle, and small correlation classer. According to the analysis and comparison of permutations, the final coefficients are fused in the term of different fusion rules according to the correlation. Finally, the fused image can be reconstructed via combining the fused coefficients and trained dictionaries.",
