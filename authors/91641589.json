            "abstract": "Recording the provenance of scientific computation results is key to the support of traceability, reproducibility and quality assessment of data products. Several data models have been explored to address this need, providing representations of workflow plans and their executions as well as means of packaging the resulting information for archiving and sharing. However, existing approaches tend to lack interoperable adoption across workflow management systems. In this work we present Workflow Run RO-Crate, an extension of RO-Crate (Research Object Crate) and Schema.org to capture the provenance of the execution of computational workflows at different levels of granularity and bundle together all their associated objects (inputs, outputs, code, etc.). The model is supported by a diverse, open community that runs regular meetings, discussing development, maintenance and adoption aspects. Workflow Run RO-Crate is already implemented by several workflow management systems, allowing interoperable comparisons between workflow runs from heterogeneous systems. We describe the model, its alignment to standards such as W3C PROV, and its implementation in six workflow systems. Finally, we illustrate the application of Workflow Run RO-Crate in two use cases of machine learning in the digital image analysis domain.",

            "abstract": "Game designers take into account the wide range of play-styles and skill levels of players to create enjoyable experiences. One important step in the game design process involves playtests with professional testers; this process is time-consuming and expensive. Hence, there exist several methods to create synthetic testers to test a game automatically. However, one shortcoming is the lack of realistic-playing with different play-styles and skill levels. In this paper, we propose a game level authoring tool that incorporates synthetic testers, which enable the control of play-styles and skill levels. Furthermore, we utilize visualization techniques to help assess the difficulty level of each part of the stage. Our user studies confirmed that our tool was effective for designing game stages appropriate for a particular type of player.",

            "abstract": "Motivation Reinforcement of HMMER search for secondary metabolism-specific Pfam domains should contribute to discover novel biosynthetic machinery of clinically important natural products. Results Here we provide a Python-based command line tool, named as KPHMMER, to extract the Pfam domains that are specific in the user-defined set of pathways in the user-defined set of organisms registered in the KEGG database. KPHMMER outperformed the previous study in detecting secondary metabolism-specific Pfam domain set. Furthermore, it was proven that KPHMMER helps reduce the computational cost compared with the case using the whole Pfam-A HMM file. We believe that KPHMMER is a powerful tool enabling to deal with many other genome-sequenced species for more general purpose.

            "abstract": "Motivation In silico methodologies to assess pharmaceutical activity and toxicity are increasingly important in QSAR, and many chemical fingerprints have been developed to tackle this problem. Among them, KEGG Chemical Function and Substructure (KCF-S) has been shown to perform well in some pharmaceutical and metabolic studies. However, the software that generates KCF-S fingerprints has limited usability: the input file must be Molfile or SDF format, and the output is only a text file. Results We established a new Python package, KCF-Convoy, to generate KCF format and KCF-S fingerprints from Molfile, SDF, SMILES, and InChI seamlessly. The obtained KCF-S was used in a number of supervised machine-learning methods to distinguish herbicides from other pesticides, and to find characteristic substructures in taxonomy groups. Availability KCF-Convoy is implemented as a Python package freely available at https://github.com/KCF-Convoy and the user can use the package management system \u201cpip\u201d and also the Docker environment.
