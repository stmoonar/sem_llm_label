            "title": "Development of Simulation Models Supporting Next-Generation Airborne Weather Radar for High Ice Water Content Monitoring",
            "abstract": "In this article, a method of extending airborne weather radar modeling to incorporate high-ice-water-content (HIWC) conditions has been developed. A novel aspect is incorporating flight test measurement data, including forward-looking radar measurements and in situ microphysics probes data, into the model and part of the evaluations of modeling. The simulation models assume a dual-polarized, airborne forward-looking radar, while for single-polarized operations, the index-of-dispersion is included as a helpful indicator for HIWC detection. The radar system simulation models are useful for design evaluations for the next generation of airborne aviation hazard monitoring and incorporate HIWC hazard detection algorithms. Example applications of the simulator, such as hazard detection based on the simulated HIWC flight encounter scenarios based on specific numeric weather prediction (NWP) model outputs, are discussed.",
