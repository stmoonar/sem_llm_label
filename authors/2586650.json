            "title": "USNAP: fast unique dense region detection and its application to lung cancer",
            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Many real-world problems can be modeled as annotated graphs. Scalable graph algorithms that extract actionable information from such data are in demand since these graphs are large, varying in topology, and have diverse node/edge annotations. When these graphs change over time they create dynamic graphs, and open the possibility to find patterns across different time points. In this article, we introduce a scalable algorithm that finds unique dense regions across time points in dynamic graphs. Such algorithms have applications in many different areas, including the biological, financial, and social domains. Results There are three important contributions to this manuscript. First, we designed a scalable algorithm, USNAP, to effectively identify dense subgraphs that are unique to a time stamp given a dynamic graph. Importantly, USNAP provides a lower bound of the density measure in each step of the greedy algorithm. Second, insights and understanding obtained from validating USNAP on real data show its effectiveness. While USNAP is domain independent, we applied it to four non-small cell lung cancer gene expression datasets. Stages in non-small cell lung cancer were modeled as dynamic graphs, and input to USNAP. Pathway enrichment analyses and comprehensive interpretations from literature show that USNAP identified biologically relevant mechanisms for different stages of cancer progression. Third, USNAP is scalable, and has a time complexity of O(m+mc\u2009log\u2009nc+nc\u2009log\u2009nc), where m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices in the dynamic graph; mc is the number of edges, and nc is the number of vertices in the collapsed graph. Availability and implementation The code of USNAP is available at https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/\u223cjuris/data/USNAP22.",

            "abstract": "Abstract MirDIP is a well-established database that aggregates microRNA-gene human interactions from multiple databases to increase coverage, reduce bias, and improve usability by providing an integrated score proportional to the probability of the interaction occurring. In version 5.2, we removed eight outdated resources, added a new resource (miRNATIP), and ran five prediction algorithms for miRBase and mirGeneDB. In total, mirDIP 5.2 includes 46 364 047 predictions for 27 936 genes and 2734 microRNAs, making it the first database to provide interactions using data from mirGeneDB. Moreover, we curated and integrated 32 497 novel microRNAs from 14 publications to accelerate the use of these novel data. In this release, we also extend the content and functionality of mirDIP by associating contexts with microRNAs, genes, and microRNA\u2013gene interactions. We collected and processed microRNA and gene expression data from 20 resources and acquired information on 330 tissue and disease contexts for 2657 microRNAs, 27 576 genes and 123 651 910 gene\u2013microRNA\u2013tissue interactions. Finally, we improved the usability of mirDIP by enabling the user to search the database using precursor IDs, and we integrated miRAnno, a network-based tool for identifying pathways linked to specific microRNAs. We also provide a mirDIP API to facilitate access to its integrated predictions. Updated mirDIP is available at https://ophid.utoronto.ca/mirDIP.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Improved bioassays have significantly increased the rate of identifying new protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and the number of detected human PPIs has greatly exceeded early estimates of human interactome size. These new PPIs provide a more complete view of disease mechanisms but precise understanding of how PPIs affect phenotype remains a challenge. It requires knowledge of PPI context (e.g. tissues, subcellular localizations), and functional roles, especially within pathways and protein complexes. The previous IID release focused on PPI context, providing networks with comprehensive tissue, disease, cellular localization, and druggability annotations. The current update adds developmental stages to the available contexts, and provides a way of assigning context to PPIs that could not be previously annotated due to insufficient data or incompatibility with available context categories (e.g. interactions between membrane and cytoplasmic proteins). This update also annotates PPIs with conservation across species, directionality in pathways, membership in large complexes, interaction stability (i.e. stable or transient), and mutation effects. Enrichment analysis is now available for all annotations, and includes multiple options; for example, context annotations can be analyzed with respect to PPIs or network proteins. In addition to tabular view or download, IID provides online network visualization. This update is available at http://ophid.utoronto.ca/iid.",

            "abstract": "The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spurred a wave of research of nearly unprecedented scale. Among the different strategies that are being used to understand the disease and develop effective treatments, the study of physical molecular interactions enables studying fine-grained resolution of the mechanisms behind the virus biology and the human organism response. Here we present a curated dataset of physical molecular interactions, manually extracted by IMEx Consortium curators focused on proteins from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and other members of the Coronaviridae family. Currently, the dataset comprises over 2,200 binarized interactions extracted from 86 publications. The dataset can be accessed in the standard formats recommended by the Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) at the IntAct database website (www.ebi.ac.uk/intact), and will be continuously updated as research on COVID-19 progresses.",

To further reduce the number of proteins with no curated pathway annotation, pathDIP integrates pathways with physical protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) to predict significant physical associations between proteins and curated pathways. For human, it provides pathway annotations for 5366 pathway orphans. Integrated pathway annotation now includes six model organisms and ten domesticated animals. A total of 6401 core and ortholog pathways have been curated from the literature or by annotating orthologs of human proteins in the literature-curated pathways. Extended pathways are the result of combining these pathways with protein-pathway associations that are predicted using organism-specific PPIs. Extended pathways expand proteome coverage from 81 088 to 120 621 proteins, making pathDIP 4 the largest publicly available pathway database for these organisms and providing a necessary platform for comprehensive pathway-enrichment analysis. PathDIP 4 users can customize their search and analysis by selecting organism, identifier and subset of pathways. Enrichment results and detailed annotations for input list can be obtained in different formats and views. To support automated bioinformatics workflows, Java, R and Python APIs are available for batch pathway annotation and enrichment analysis.

            "abstract": "Abstract Knowing the set of physical protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) that occur in a particular context\u2014a tissue, disease, or other condition\u2014can provide valuable insights into key research questions. However, while the number of identified human PPIs is expanding rapidly, context information remains limited, and for most non-human species context-specific networks are completely unavailable. The Integrated Interactions Database (IID) provides one of the most comprehensive sets of context-specific human PPI networks, including networks for 133 tissues, 91 disease conditions, and many other contexts. Importantly, it also provides context-specific networks for 17 non-human species including model organisms and domesticated animals. These species are vitally important for drug discovery and agriculture. IID integrates interactions from multiple databases and datasets. It comprises over 4.8 million PPIs annotated with several types of context: tissues, subcellular localizations, diseases, and druggability information (the latter three are new annotations not available in the previous version). This update increases the number of species from 6 to 18, the number of PPIs from \u223c1.5 million to \u223c4.8 million, and the number of tissues from 30 to 133. IID also now supports topology and enrichment analyses of returned networks. IID is available at http://ophid.utoronto.ca/iid.",

            "abstract": "Given a large, dynamic graph, how can we trace the activities of groups of vertices over time? Given a dynamic biological graph modeling a given disease progression, which genes interact closely at the early stage of the disease, and their interactions are being disrupted in the latter stage of the disease? Which genes interact sparsely at the early stage of the disease, and their interactions increase as the disease progresses? Knowing the answers to these questions is important as they give insights to the underlying molecular mechanism to disease progression, and potential treatments that target these mechanisms can be developed. There are three main contributions to this paper. First, we designed a novel algorithm, SDREGION, that identifies subgraphs that decrease or increase in density monotonically over time, referred to as d-regions or i-regions, respectively. We introduced the objective function, -density, for identifying d-(i-)regions. Second, SDREGION is a generic algorithm, applicable across several real datasets. In this manuscript, we showed its effectiveness, and made observations in the modeling of the progression of lung cancer. In particular, we observed that SDREGION identified d-(i-)regions that capture mechanisms that align with literature. Importantly, findings that were identified but were not retrospectively validated by literature may provide novel mechanisms in tumor progression that will guide future biological experiments. Third, SDREGION is scalable with a time complexity of O(mlogn + nlogn) where m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices in a given dynamic graph.",

            "abstract": "IID (Integrated Interactions Database) is the first database providing tissue-specific protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) for model organisms and human. IID covers six species (S. cerevisiae (yeast), C. elegans (worm), D. melonogaster (fly), R. norvegicus (rat), M. musculus (mouse) and H. sapiens (human)) and up to 30 tissues per species. Users query IID by providing a set of proteins or PPIs from any of these organisms, and specifying species and tissues where IID should search for interactions. If query proteins are not from the selected species, IID enables searches across species and tissues automatically by using their orthologs; for example, retrieving interactions in a given tissue, conserved in human and mouse. Interaction data in IID comprises three types of PPI networks: experimentally detected PPIs from major databases, orthologous PPIs and high-confidence computationally predicted PPIs. Interactions are assigned to tissues where their proteins pairs or encoding genes are expressed. IID is a major replacement of the I2D interaction database, with larger PPI networks (a total of 1,566,043 PPIs among 68,831 proteins), tissue annotations for interactions, and new query, analysis and data visualization capabilities.

            "abstract": "Repurposing FDA-approved drugs with the aid of gene signatures of disease can accelerate the development of new therapeutics. A major challenge to developing reliable drug predictions is heterogeneity. Different gene signatures of the same disease or drug treatment often show poor overlap across studies, as a consequence of both biological and technical variability, and this can affect the quality and reproducibility of computational drug predictions. Existing algorithms for signature-based drug repurposing use only individual signatures as input. But for many diseases, there are dozens of signatures in the public domain. Methods that exploit all available transcriptional knowledge on a disease should produce improved drug predictions. Here, we adapt an established meta-analysis framework to address the problem of drug repurposing using an ensemble of disease signatures. Our computational pipeline takes as input a collection of disease signatures, and outputs a list of drugs predicted to consistently reverse pathological gene changes. We apply our method to conduct the largest and most systematic repurposing study on lung cancer transcriptomes, using 21 signatures. We show that scaling up transcriptional knowledge significantly increases the reproducibility of top drug hits, from 44% to 78%. We extensively characterize drug hits in silico, demonstrating that they slow growth significantly in nine lung cancer cell lines from the NCI-60 collection, and identify CALM1 and PLA2G4A as promising drug targets for lung cancer. Our meta-analysis pipeline is general, and applicable to any disease context; it can be applied to improve the results of signature-based drug repurposing by leveraging the large number of disease signatures in the public domain.",
