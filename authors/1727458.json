            "title": "Non-Binary LDPC Code Design for Energy-Time Entanglement Quantum Key Distribution",
            "abstract": "In energy-time entanglement Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), two users extract a shared secret key from the arrival times (discretized as symbols) of entangled photon pairs. In prior work, Zhou et al. proposed a multi-level coding (MLC) scheme that splits the observed symbols into bit layers and utilizes binary Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes for reconciliation of the symbols. While binary LDPC codes offer low latency for key generation, splitting the symbols into bits results in a loss of key generation rate due to error propagation. Additionally, existing LDPC codes do not fully utilize the properties of the QKD channel to optimize the key rates. In this paper, we mitigate the above issues by first generalizing the MLC scheme to a non-binary(NB) MLC scheme that has layers with non-binary symbols and utilizes NB-LDPC codes. We show the NB-MLC scheme offers flexibility in system design. Additionally, we show that the NB-MLC scheme with a small symbol size per layer offers the best trade-off between latency and key rate. We then propose a framework to jointly optimize the rate and degree profile of the NB-LDPC codes that is tailored towards the QKD channel resulting in higher key rates than prior work.",

            "abstract": "Recent scientific and technological advances have enabled the detection of gravitational waves, autonomous driving, and the proposal of a communications network on the Moon (Lunar Internet or LunaNet). These efforts are based on the measurement of minute displacements and their corresponding force transduction, which enables acceleration, velocity, and position determination for navigation. State\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art accelerometers use capacitive or piezoresistive techniques and micro\u2010electromechanical systems (MEMS) via integrated circuit (IC) technologies to drive transducers and convert their output for electric readout. In recent years, laser optomechanical transduction and readout have enabled highly sensitive detection of motional displacement. Here the theoretical framework is further examined for the novel mechanical frequency readout technique of optomechanical transduction when the sensor is driven into oscillation mode. Theoretical and physical agreements are demonstrated, and the most relevant performance parameters are characterized by a device with a 1.5 mg Hz\u22121 acceleration sensitivity, a 2.5 fm Hz\u22121/2 displacement resolution corresponding to a 17.02 \u00b5g Hz\u22121/2 force\u2010equivalent acceleration, and a 5.91 Hz nW\u22121 power sensitivity, at the thermodynamical limits. In addition, a novel technique is presented for dynamic range extension while maintaining the precision sensing sensitivity. This inertial accelerometer is integrated on\u2010chip and enabled for packaging, with a laser\u2010detuning\u2010enabled approach.",

            "title": "A 6\u03bcm-Precision Pulsed-Coherent Lidar with a 40-dB Tuning Range Inverter-Based Phase-Invariant PGA",
            "abstract": "Lidars are becoming common components for remote sensing in many emerging applications such as autonomous vehicle and facial recognition. To accurately visualize the point cloud for further data processing, metrics such as precision, sampling rate, and linearity are important. The concept of a sub-sampling pulsed-coherent lidar system [1] has demonstrated high precision and fast acquisition. The segmented time-of-flight (ToF) algorithm measures the phase shift of the carrier as fine ToF and counts the arrival time of the low-frequency mask\u2019s envelope as intermediate and coarse ToF. Fig. 1(a) shows the down-conversion architecture in [1] using a simple LO generation which only uses dividers and a mixer to minimize the clock jitter. The performance based on the coherent detection, however, is limited by several factors. (1) The crosstalk between the reference clock and the echoed signal at the same frequency lowers the sensitivity and the linearity. Specifically, the reference leaks to the incoming signal path hence introducing an in-band spur. At the same time, the received signals with different power pull the clock phase and cause input-dependent phase shifts. (2) I/Q IF channels and two high-speed ADCs are required to reconstruct the mask\u2019s envelope leading to high power consumption. Additionally, I/Q mismatch calibration process must be done prior to the normal acquisition. In this work, a local PLL synthesizes the LO to suppress the in-band reference leakage and crosstalk. A two-step down-conversion with digital down-mixing is implemented which improves the power efficiency and immunity to PVT variation without additional calibration. We also propose an inverter-based phase-invariant programmable gain amplifier (PI-PGA) that improves the linearity with a 40-dB tuning range. This calibration-free system achieves 6-\u03bcm precision and 30-\u03bcm INLMax with a 5-MSa/s sampling rate.",

            "abstract": "Graph based codes such as low density parity check (LDPC) codes have been shown promising for the information reconciliation phase in quantum key distribution (QKD). However, existing graph coding schemes have not fully utilized the properties of the QKD channel. In this work, we first investigate the channel statistics for discrete variable (DV) QKD based on energy-time entangled photons. We then establish a so-called balanced modulation scheme that is promising for this channel. Based on the modulation, we propose a joint local-global graph coding scheme that is expected to achieve good error-correction performance.",
