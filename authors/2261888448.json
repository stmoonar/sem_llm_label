            "title": "Multi-Modal Generative AI: Multi-modal LLM, Diffusion and Beyond",
            "abstract": "Multi-modal generative AI has received increasing attention in both academia and industry. Particularly, two dominant families of techniques are: i) The multi-modal large language model (MLLM) such as GPT-4V, which shows impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; ii) The diffusion model such as Sora, which exhibits remarkable multi-modal powers, especially with respect to visual generation. As such, one natural question arises: Is it possible to have a unified model for both understanding and generation? To answer this question, in this paper, we first provide a detailed review of both MLLM and diffusion models, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video large language models as well as text-to-image/video generation. Then, we discuss the two important questions on the unified model: i) whether the unified model should adopt the auto-regressive or diffusion probabilistic modeling, and ii) whether the model should utilize a dense architecture or the Mixture of Experts(MoE) architectures to better support generation and understanding, two objectives. We further provide several possible strategies for building a unified model and analyze their potential advantages and disadvantages. We also summarize existing large-scale multi-modal datasets for better model pretraining in the future. To conclude the paper, we present several challenging future directions, which we believe can contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.",

            "abstract": "Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG), which aims to localize moments from videos based on the given natural language queries, has attracted widespread attention. Existing works are mainly designed for short videos, failing to handle TSG in long videos, which poses two challenges: i) complicated contexts in long videos require temporal reasoning over longer moment sequences, and ii) multiple modalities including textual speech with rich information require special designs for content understanding in long videos. To tackle these challenges, in this work we propose a Grounding-Prompter method, which is capable of conducting TSG in long videos through prompting LLM with multimodal information. In detail, we first transform the TSG task and its multimodal inputs including speech and visual, into compressed task textualization. Furthermore, to enhance temporal reasoning under complicated contexts, a Boundary-Perceptive Prompting strategy is proposed, which contains three folds: i) we design a novel Multiscale Denoising Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to combine global and local semantics with noise filtering step by step, ii) we set up validity principles capable of constraining LLM to generate reasonable predictions following specific formats, and iii) we introduce one-shot In-Context-Learning (ICL) to boost reasoning through imitation, enhancing LLM in TSG task understanding. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our Grounding-Prompter method, revealing the benefits of prompting LLM with multimodal information for TSG in long videos.",

            "title": "Curriculum-Listener: Consistency- and Complementarity-Aware Audio-Enhanced Temporal Sentence Grounding",
            "abstract": "Temporal Sentence Grounding aims to retrieve a video moment given a natural language query. Most existing literature merely focuses on visual information in videos without considering the naturally accompanied audio which may contain rich semantics. The few works considering audio simply regard it as an additional modality, overlooking that: i) it's non-trivial to explore consistency and complementarity between audio and visual; ii) such exploration requires handling different levels of information densities and noises in the two modalities. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive Dual-branch Promoted Network (ADPN) to exploit such consistency and complementarity: i) we introduce a dual-branch pipeline capable of jointly training visual-only and audio-visual branches to simultaneously eliminate inter-modal interference; ii) we design Text-Guided Clues Miner (TGCM) to discover crucial locating clues via considering both consistency and complementarity during audio-visual interaction guided by text semantics; iii) we propose a novel curriculum-based denoising optimization strategy, where we adaptively evaluate sample difficulty as a measure of noise intensity in a self-aware fashion. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our method.",
