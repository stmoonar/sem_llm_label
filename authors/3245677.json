            "title": "Rethinking Large Language Model Architectures for Sequential Recommendations",
            "abstract": "Recently, sequential recommendation has been adapted to the LLM paradigm to enjoy the power of LLMs. LLM-based methods usually formulate recommendation information into natural language and the model is trained to predict the next item in an auto-regressive manner. Despite their notable success, the substantial computational overhead of inference poses a significant obstacle to their real-world applicability. In this work, we endeavor to streamline existing LLM-based recommendation models and propose a simple yet highly effective model Lite-LLM4Rec. The primary goal of Lite-LLM4Rec is to achieve efficient inference for the sequential recommendation task. Lite-LLM4Rec circumvents the beam search decoding by using a straight item projection head for ranking scores generation. This design stems from our empirical observation that beam search decoding is ultimately unnecessary for sequential recommendations. Additionally, Lite-LLM4Rec introduces a hierarchical LLM structure tailored to efficiently handle the extensive contextual information associated with items, thereby reducing computational overhead while enjoying the capabilities of LLMs. Experiments on three publicly available datasets corroborate the effectiveness of Lite-LLM4Rec in both performance and inference efficiency (notably 46.8% performance improvement and 97.28% efficiency improvement on ML-1m) over existing LLM-based methods. Our implementations will be open sourced.",

            "title": "Trending Now: Modeling Trend Recommendations",
            "abstract": "Modern recommender systems usually include separate recommendation carousels such as \u2018trending now\u2019 to list trending items and further boost their popularity, thereby attracting active users. Though widely useful, such \u2018trending now\u2019 carousels typically generate item lists based on simple heuristics, e.g., the number of interactions within a time interval, and therefore still leave much room for improvement. This paper aims to systematically study this under-explored but important problem from the new perspective of time series forecasting. We first provide a set of rigorous definitions related to item trendiness and formulate the trend recommendation task as a one-step time series forecasting problem. We then propose a deep latent variable model, dubbed Trend Recommender (TrendRec), to forecast items\u2019 future trends and generate trending item lists. Furthermore, we design associated evaluation protocols for trend recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets from various domains show that our TrendRec significantly outperforms the baselines, verifying our model\u2019s effectiveness.",

Multitask neural network is employed to predict a customer's propensity to purchase within fine-grained categories. The network is then fine-tuned using transfer learning for a specific promotional campaign. Lastly, retail revenue and promotional revenue are jointly optimized conditioned on customer loyalty. Experiments are conducted using a large retail dataset that shows the efficacy of the proposed method compared to baselines used in the industry. A large retailer is currently adopting the proposed methodology in promotional campaigning owing to significant overall revenue and loyalty gains.",

            "abstract": "Representation learning has recently been successfully used to create vector representations of entities in language learning, recommender systems and in similarity learning. Graph embeddings exploit the locality structure of a graph and generate embeddings for nodes which could be words in a language, products of a retail website; and the nodes are connected based on a context window. In this paper, we consider graph embeddings with an error-free associative learning update rule, which models the embedding vector of node as a non-convex Gaussian mixture of the embeddings of the nodes in its immediate vicinity with some constant variance that is reduced as iterations progress. It is very easy to parallelize our algorithm without any form of shared memory, which makes it possible to use it on very large graphs with a much higher dimensionality of the embeddings. We study the efficacy of proposed method on several benchmark data sets and favorably compare with state of the art methods. Further, proposed method is applied to generate relevant recommendations for a large retailer.",

The optimization is performed using genetic algorithm for obtaining global optimal parameters. The developed method is applied on simulated and ECG data and found to perform better than the methods which utilize the AR coefficients as the features for the classification.",

The oscillator is operated at a relatively high gain immediately after power is applied and until the oscillator is running, after which the oscillator is caused to operate under the normally preferred conditions. A power up pulse sets a latch and the latch is reset by either a pulse from the prescaler or a manual input. When the latch is set, the oscillator circuit is modified for quick start-up. After the oscillator is running, it activates the prescaler, and after several cycles of clock inputs to the prescaler, an output from the prescaler or a manual input resets the latch and the oscillator is returned to its normal operating condition.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel approach for nonlinear time series prediction using kernel methods. The kernel methods such as support vector machine (SVM) and support vector regression (SVR) deal with nonlinear problems assuming independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data, without explicit notion of time. However, the problem of prediction necessitates temporal information. In this regard, we propose a novel time series modeling technique, kernel auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (KARX) and associated estimation methods. Amongst others the advantage of KARX model compared to the widely used nonlinear auto-regressive exogenous (NARX) model (which is implemented using artificial neural network (ANN)) is, implicit nonlinear mapping and better regularization capability. In this work, we make use of Kalman recursions instead of quadratic programming which is generally used in kernel methods. Also, we employ online estimation schemes for estimating model noise parameters. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated on artificial time series as well as real world time series acquired from aircraft engines",
