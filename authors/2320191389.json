            "abstract": "Hyperspectral images super-resolution (HSI-SR) aims to fuse low-resolution HSI (LR-HSIs) and high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSIs) for high-resolution HSIs (HR-HSIs). Most existing methods require registered image pairs and prior knowledge of spectral response functions (SRFs), which requires effort to realize in practical applications. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an unsupervised blind HSI-SR method (UBHSI-SR) for unregistered HSIs and MSIs. UBHSI-SR consists of two unmixing branches, each having its own encoder while sharing the decoder. First, the HSI unmixing branch learns to predict abundance maps and learns precise endmember spectra. Then, the learnable SRF transfers LR-HSIs to the registered LR-MSIs. The abundance similarity constraint between LR-HSIs and LR-MSIs guides the learning of the MSI encoder. With the abundance maps of HR-MSI, the shared decoder predicts the HR-HSIs as final results. Experiments on three remote sensing datasets validate the superior performance of UBHSI-SR to existing fusion methods.",

            "title": "SSFDD: Spectral-Spatial Feature Decoupled Detector for Box-Level Object Detection in Hyperspectral Images",
            "abstract": "Spectral feature differences between various materials in hyperspectral images (HSIs) allow detection of targets. In recent years, box-level hyperspectral object detection (HOD) has gained attention owing to improved spatial resolutions of HSIs. However, existing HOD methods mainly rely on spatial features and lack dedicated optimization for spectral feature extraction. Additionally, the limited high-spatial-resolution HSIs restrict their generalization capability. This paper proposes a spectral-spatial feature decoupled detector (SSFDD) to solve the above problems. First, a pixel-level detection module is proposed to decouple spectral features optimized with the dedicated loss. Meanwhile, HSIs are spectral-down-sampled to multispectral images (MSIs) for decoupled spatial features. Then, a Siamese fusion network (SFN) is designed to extract and fuse the decoupled spectral-spatial features for object detection. SBN is initialized with pre-trained models on RGB-image datasets to enhance generalization capability. Experimental results on a high-resolution HSI dataset validate the superior performance of the SSFDD.",
