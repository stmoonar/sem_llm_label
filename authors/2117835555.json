            "title": "Denoising and Prompt-Tuning for Multi-Behavior Recommendation",
            "abstract": "In practical recommendation scenarios, users often interact with items under multi-typed behaviors (e.g., click, add-to-cart, and purchase). Traditional collaborative filtering techniques typically assume that users only have a single type of behavior with items, making it insufficient to utilize complex collaborative signals to learn informative representations and infer actual user preferences. Consequently, some pioneer studies explore modeling multi-behavior heterogeneity to learn better representations and boost the performance of recommendations for a target behavior. However, a large number of auxiliary behaviors (i.e., click and add-to-cart) could introduce irrelevant information to recommenders, which could mislead the target behavior (i.e., purchase) recommendation, rendering two critical challenges: (i) denoising auxiliary behaviors and (ii) bridging the semantic gap between auxiliary and target behaviors. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel framework\u2013Denoising and Prompt-Tuning (DPT) with a three-stage learning paradigm to solve the aforementioned challenges. In particular, DPT is equipped with a pattern-enhanced graph encoder in the first stage to learn complex patterns as prior knowledge in a data-driven manner to guide learning informative representation and pinpointing reliable noise for subsequent stages. Accordingly, we adopt different lightweight tuning approaches with effectiveness and efficiency in the following stages to further attenuate the influence of noise and alleviate the semantic gap among multi-typed behaviors. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DPT over a wide range of state-of-the-art methods.

            "abstract": "Transformer models have achieved remarkable success in sequential recommender systems (SRSs). However, computing the attention matrix in traditional dot-product attention mechanisms results in a quadratic complexity with sequence lengths, leading to high computational costs for long-term sequential recommendation. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel L2-Normalized Linear Attention for the Transformer-based Sequential Recommender Systems (LinRec), which theoretically improves efficiency while preserving the learning capabilities of the traditional dot-product attention. Specifically, by thoroughly examining the equivalence conditions of efficient attention mechanisms, we show that LinRec possesses linear complexity while preserving the property of attention mechanisms. In addition, we reveal its latent efficiency properties by interpreting the proposed LinRec mechanism through a statistical lens. Extensive experiments are conducted based on two public benchmark datasets, demonstrating that the combination of LinRec and Transformer models achieves comparable or even superior performance than state-of-the-art Transformer-based SRS models while significantly improving time and memory efficiency.

            "abstract": "The wide popularity of short videos on social media poses new opportunities and challenges to optimize recommender systems on the video-sharing platforms. Users sequentially interact with the system and provide complex and multi-faceted responses, including WatchTime and various types of interactions with multiple videos. On the one hand, the platforms aim at optimizing the users\u2019 cumulative WatchTime (main goal) in the long term, which can be effectively optimized by Reinforcement Learning. On the other hand, the platforms also need to satisfy the constraint of accommodating the responses of multiple user interactions (auxiliary goals) such as Like, Follow, Share, etc. In this paper, we formulate the problem of short video recommendation as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). We find that traditional constrained reinforcement learning algorithms fail to work well in this setting. We propose a novel two-stage constrained actor-critic method: At stage one, we learn individual policies to optimize each auxiliary signal. In stage two, we learn a policy to (i) optimize the main signal and (ii) stay close to policies learned in the first stage, which effectively guarantees the performance of this main policy on the auxiliaries. Through extensive offline evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over alternatives in both optimizing the main goal as well as balancing the others. We further show the advantage of our method in live experiments of short video recommendations, where it significantly outperforms other baselines in terms of both WatchTime and interactions. Our approach has been fully launched in the production system to optimize user experiences on the platform.",

            "abstract": "As an emerging paradigm, session-based recommendation is aimed at recommending the next item based on a set of anonymous sessions. Effectively representing a session that is normally a short interaction sequence renders a major technical challenge. In view of the limitations of pioneering studies that explore collaborative information from other sessions, in this paper we propose a new direction to enhance session representations by learning multi-faceted session-independent global item relations. In particular, we identify three types of advantageous global item relations, including negative relations that have not been studied before, and propose different graph construction methods to capture such relations. We then devise a novel multi-faceted global item relation (MGIR) model to encode different relations using different aggregation layers and generate enhanced session representations by fusing positive and negative relations. Our solution is flexible to accommodate new item relations and can easily integrate existing session representation learning methods to generate better representations from global relation enhanced session information. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over a large number of state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, we show that learning negative relations is critical for session-based recommendation.",

            "title": "Hierarchical Item Inconsistency Signal Learning for Sequence Denoising in Sequential Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems aim to recommend the next items in which target users are most interested based on their historical interaction sequences. In practice, historical sequences typically contain some inherent noise (e.g., accidental interactions), which is harmful to learn accurate sequence representations and thus misleads the next-item recommendation. However, the absence of supervised signals (i.e., labels indicating noisy items) makes the problem of sequence denoising rather challenging. To this end, we propose a novel sequence denoising paradigm for sequential recommendation by learning hierarchical item inconsistency signals. More specifically, we design a hierarchical sequence denoising (HSD) model, which first learns two levels of inconsistency signals in input sequences, and then generates noiseless subsequences (i.e., dropping inherent noisy items) for subsequent sequential recommenders. It is noteworthy that HSD is flexible to accommodate supervised item signals, if any, and can be seamlessly integrated with most existing sequential recommendation models to boost their performance. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HSD over state-of-the-art denoising methods and its applicability over a wide variety of mainstream sequential recommendation models.
