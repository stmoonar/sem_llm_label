            "title": "Deep Homography Estimation With Feature Correlation Transformer",
            "abstract": "Homography estimation is an important image alignment method that has been widely used in computer vision applications. Traditional methods heavily rely on the distribution of features and usually fail in low-texture and large-baseline scenes. Most learning-based methods use convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to extract features. However, the dense features extracted in this way have a limited receptive field, leading to poor accuracy of results. In this paper, we propose a novel method for homography estimation. We first estimate the projective transformation between the reference image and the target image at a coarse level and then refine the estimated homography at the fine level. Unlike approaches that use simple CNNs or global correlations to search correspondences, we add self- and cross-attention layers in the transformer to enhance the feature correlations. The experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the existing solutions in challenging large-baseline scenes.",

            "abstract": "instance segmentation has become a hot topic in computer vision, which is a combination of semantic image segmentation and object detection. In this work, we propose a new network MaskSAN for instance segmentation, which has three outputs: box prediction, semantic segmentation, and classification score. In this network, Superpixel-pooling is used to increase the spatial prior information of features and enhance the edge performance of segmentation. In addition, the network also combines the recently popular attention modules to enhance the feature extraction module of the network and the context information in feature extraction. Without reducing the speed, the accuracy of segmentation and detection is improved. The network makes full use of the image\u2019s own information and enhances the constraints. Our proposed network performs experiments on the public coco dataset and has excellent performance in detection and segmentation.",

            "title": "Dual-Supervised Instance Segmentation Network Combined with Priori Corner Information",
            "abstract": "Instance segmentation is a classic problem in the field of computer vision, where the goal is to classify every pixel and differentiate object instances. Mask R-CNN is one of the most advanced and efficient algorithms in the field of instance segmentation. In practice, however, Mask R-CNN algorithm does not perform well when segmenting slender parts and edge parts of the object, not only in the standard COCO dataset but also in self-made dataset. Aiming at this problem, we propose a dual-supervised network combined with priori corner information called Corner Mask R-CNN. By using corner points as a priori information to allow the network to fit the edge parts better, the details of the instance corner points can be maintained, thereby achieving more accurate results of predictions. In addition, in order to enhance the feature expression ability of the network, a Squeeze & Excitation module is added which is similar to the attention mechanism. The method proposed is more accurate than Mask R-CNN in the MS-COCO dataset. Specifically, the average precision is 1.2 percent higher than Mask R-CNN. Besides, Corner Mask R-CNN is more effective in segmenting large objects, which is 2.5 percent higher than the benchmark network.",

In this paper, we address the instance segmentation task with a network called Mask-FgS, which is based on Mask R-CNN. In addition, in our model, the output of the network is still with three branches: box prediction, semantic segmentation, and classification score. Our network proposes a new feature extraction module that improves the performance of the feature pyramid and provides significant improvements in both accuracy and speed. Furthermore, Supsampling replaces traditional bilinear upsampling in the network on mask branches. The proposed network performs experiments in the instance segmentation branch of the coco data set, and the performance of detection and segmentation is better than the current instance segmentation networks.",
