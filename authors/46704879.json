            "abstract": "To analyze and process graph data, researchers have proposed Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. In this paper, we focus on methods for boosting the performance of existing GNN models and propose GraphHI, a GNN framework that integrates Hidden Insights to enhance the performance of a given GNN model. We propose to utilize both inter-model and intra-model hidden insights. The inter-model hidden insights encompass the embedding vectors and logit vectors derived from other pretrained models using the same graph data. The intra-model hidden insights incorporate the embedding vectors of other nodes from the same GNN model. To optimize the suitability of hidden insights for GNN model training, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the influence of various forms of the transformed logits and the parameter $T$ in the data transformation function. Based on this analysis, a method for setting dynamic personalized parameters in the data transformation is proposed, which is tailored to the current state of each node in the GNN model. To integrate multiple sources of hidden insights, we propose ALC, an algorithm that dynamically sets appropriate combination coefficients for various loss terms. The experimental results show that GraphHI can boost the performance of GNN models using different pretrained models in four different tasks.",

            "abstract": "Collecting full annotations to construct multi-label datasets is difficult and labor-consuming. As an effective solution to relieve the annotation burden, single positive multi-label learning (SPML) draws increasing attention from both academia and industry. It only annotates each image with one positive label, leaving other labels unobserved. Therefore, existing methods strive to explore the cue of unobserved labels to compensate for the insufficiency of label supervision. Though achieving promising performance, they generally consider labels independently, leaving out the inherent hierarchical semantic relationship among labels which reveals that labels can be clustered into groups. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical prompt learning method with a novel Hierarchical Semantic Prompt Network (HSPNet) to harness such hierarchical semantic relationships using a large-scale pretrained vision and language model, i.e., CLIP, for SPML. We first introduce a Hierarchical Conditional Prompt (HCP) strategy to grasp the hierarchical label-group dependency. Then we equip a Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network (HGCN) to capture the high-order inter-label and inter-group dependencies. Comprehensive experiments and analyses on several benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, well demonstrating its superiority and effectiveness.

            "abstract": "Multi-label recognition (MLR) with incomplete labels is very challenging. Recent works strive to explore the image-to-label correspondence in the vision-language model, i.e., CLIP [22], to compensate for insufficient annotations. In spite of promising performance, they generally overlook the valuable prior about the label-to-label correspondence. In this paper, we advocate remedying the deficiency of label supervision for the MLR with incomplete labels by deriving a structured semantic prior about the label-to-label corre-spondence via a semantic prior prompter. We then present a novel Semantic Correspondence Prompt Network (SCP-Net), which can thoroughly explore the structured semantic prior. A Prior-Enhanced Self-Supervised Learning method is further introduced to enhance the use of the prior. Comprehensive experiments and analyses on several widely used benchmark datasets show that our method significantly out-performs existing methods on all datasets, well demonstrating the effectiveness and the superiority of our method.

            "abstract": "It has become increasingly common that sponsored content (i.e., paid ads) and non-sponsored content are jointly displayed to users, especially on e-commerce platforms. Thus, both of these contents may interact together to influence their engagement behaviors. In general, sponsored content helps brands achieve their marketing goals and provides ad revenue to the platforms. In contrast, non-sponsored content contributes to the long-term health of the platform through increasing users' engagement. A key conundrum to platforms is learning how to blend both of these contents allowing their interactions to be considered and balancing these business objectives. This paper proposes a system built for this purpose and applied to product detail pages of JD.COM, an e-commerce company. This system achieves three objectives: (a) Optimization of competing business objectives via Virtual Bids allowing the expressiveness of the valuation of the platform for these objectives. (b) Modeling the users' click behaviors considering explicitly the influence exerted by the sponsored and non-sponsored content displayed alongside through a deep learning approach. (c) Consideration of a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) Auction design compatible with the allocation of ads and its induced externalities. Experiments are presented demonstrating the performance of the proposed system. Moreover, our approach is fully deployed and serves all traffic through JD.COM's mobile application.",

            "abstract": "Retrieving relevant items that match users\u2019 queries from billion-scale corpus forms the core of industrial e-commerce search systems, in which embedding-based retrieval (EBR) methods are prevailing. These methods adopt a two-tower framework to learn embedding vectors for query and item separately and thus leverage efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to retrieve relevant items. However, existing EBR methods usually ignore inconsistent user behaviors in industrial multi-stage search systems, resulting in insufficient retrieval efficiency with a low commercial return. To tackle this challenge, we propose to improve EBR methods by learning Multi-level Multi-Grained Semantic Embeddings (MMSE). We propose the multi-stage information mining to exploit the ordered, clicked, unclicked and random sampled items in practical user behavior data, and then capture query-item similarity via a post-fusion strategy. We then propose multi-grained learning objectives that integrate the retrieval loss with global comparison ability and the ranking loss with local comparison ability to generate semantic embeddings. Both experiments on a real-world billion-scale dataset and online A/B tests verify the effectiveness of MMSE in achieving significant performance improvements on metrics such as offline recall and online conversion rate (CVR).",

Existing generative methods usually treat the output as a whole string rather than the combination of different elements and only focus on a single task at once. This paper proposes a unified generative multi-task framework that can solve multiple ABSA tasks by controlling the type of task prompts consisting of multiple element prompts. Further, the proposed approach can train on simple tasks and transfer to difficult tasks by assembling task prompts, like assembling Lego bricks. We conduct experiments on six ABSA tasks across multiple benchmarks. Our proposed multi-task approach achieves new state-of-the-art results in almost all tasks and competitive results in task transfer scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Conducting experiments with objectives that take significant delays to materialize (e.g. conversions, add-to-cart events, etc.) is challenging. Although the classical \u201csplit sample testing\u201d is still valid for the delayed feedback, the experiment will take longer to complete, which also means spending more resources on worse-performing strategies due to their fixed allocation schedules. Alternatively, adaptive approaches such as \u201cmulti-armed bandits\u201d are able to effectively reduce the cost of experimentation. But these methods generally cannot handle delayed objectives directly out of the box. This paper presents an adaptive experimentation solution tailored for delayed binary feedback objectives by estimating the real underlying objectives before they materialize and dynamically allocating variants based on the estimates. Experiments show that the proposed method is more efficient for delayed feedback compared to various other approaches and is robust in different settings. In addition, we describe an experimentation product powered by this algorithm. This product is currently deployed in the online experimentation platform of JD.com, a large e-commerce company and a publisher of digital ads.",

            "abstract": "In product description generation (PDG), the user-cared aspect is critical for the recommendation system, which can not only improve user's experiences but also obtain more clicks. High-quality customer reviews can be considered as an ideal source to mine user-cared aspects. However, in reality, a large number of new products (known as long-tailed commodities) cannot gather sufficient amount of customer reviews, which brings a big challenge in the product description generation task. Existing works tend to generate the product description solely based on item information, i.e., product attributes or title words, which leads to tedious contents and cannot attract customers effectively. To tackle this problem, we propose an adaptive posterior network based on Transformer architecture that can utilize user-cared information from customer reviews. Specifically, we first extend the self-attentive Transformer encoder to encode product titles and attributes. Then, we apply an adaptive posterior distillation module to utilize useful review information, which integrates user-cared aspects to the generation process. Finally, we apply a Transformer-based decoding phase with copy mechanism to automatically generate the product description. Besides, we also collect a large-scare Chinese product description dataset to support our work and further research in this field. Experimental results show that our model is superior to traditional generative models in both automatic indicators and human evaluation.",

            "abstract": "In e-commerce platforms, sponsored and non-sponsored content are jointly displayed to users and both may interactively influence their engagement behavior. The former content helps advertisers achieve their marketing goals and provides a stream of ad revenue to the platform. The latter content contributes to users' engagement with the platform, which is key to its long-term health. A burning issue for e-commerce platform design is how to blend advertising with content in a way that respects these interactions and balances these multiple business objectives. This paper describes a system developed for this purpose in the context of blending personalized sponsored content with non-sponsored content on the product detail pages of JD.COM, an e-commerce company. This system has three key features: (1) Optimization of multiple competing business objectives through a new virtual bids approach and the expressiveness of the latent, implicit valuation of the platform for the multiple objectives via these virtual bids. (2) Modeling of users' click behavior as a function of their characteristics, the individual characteristics of each sponsored content and the influence exerted by other sponsored and non-sponsored content displayed alongside through a deep learning approach; (3) Consideration of externalities in the allocation of ads, thereby making it directly compatible with a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction scheme for the computation of payments in the presence of these externalities. The system is currently deployed and serving all traffic through JD.COM's mobile application. Experiments demonstrating the performance and advantages of the system are presented.",

            "title": "Adversarial Mixture Of Experts with Category Hierarchy Soft Constraint",
            "abstract": "Product search is the most common way for people to satisfy their shopping needs on e-commerce websites. Products are typically annotated with one of several broad categorical tags, such as \"Clothing\" or \"Electronics\", as well as finer-grained categories like \"Refrigerator\" or \"TV\", both under \"Electronics\". These tags are used to construct a hierarchy of query categories. Distributions of features such as price and brand popularity vary wildly across query categories. In addition, feature importance for the purpose of CTR/CVR predictions differs from one category to another. In this work, we leverage the Mixture of Expert (MoE) framework to learn a ranking model that specializes for each query category. In particular, our gate network relies solely on the category ids extracted from the user query.While classical MoE\u2019s pick expert towers spontaneously for each input example, we explore two techniques to establish more explicit and transparent connections between the experts and query categories. To help differentiate experts on their domain specialties, we introduce a form of adversarial regularization among the expert outputs, forcing them to disagree with one another. As a result, they tend to approach each prediction problem from different angles, rather than copying one another. This is validated by a much stronger clustering effect of the gate output vectors under different categories. In addition, soft gating constraints based on the categorical hierarchy are imposed to help similar products choose similar gate values. and make them more likely to share similar experts. This allows aggregation of training data among smaller sibling categories to overcome data scarcity.Experiments on a learning-to-rank dataset collected from the JD e-commerce search log demonstrate that MoE with these improvements consistently outperforms competing models, in terms of offline metrics and online AB tests.",
