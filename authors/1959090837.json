            "title": "Clinical-Inspired Cytological Whole Slide Image Screening with Just Slide-Level Labels",
            "abstract": "\u2014Cytology test is effective, non-invasive, convenient, and inexpensive for clinical cancer screening. ThinPrep, a commonly used liquid-based specimen, can be scanned to generate digital whole slide images (WSIs) for cytology testing. However, WSIs classification with gi-gapixel resolutions is highly resource-intensive, posing significant challenges for automated medical image analysis. In order to circumvent this computational impasse, existing methods emphasize learning features at the cell or patch level, typically requiring labor-intensive and detailed manual annotations, such as labels at the cell or patch level. Here we propose a novel automated Label-Efficient WSI Screening method, dubbed LESS , for cytology-based diagnosis with only slide-level labels. Firstly, in order to achieve label efficiency, we suggest employing variational positive-unlabeled (VPU) learning, enhancing patch-level feature learning using WSI-level labels. Subsequently, guided by the clinical approach of scrutinizing WSIs at varying fields of view and scales, we employ a cross-attention vision transformer (CrossViT) to fuse multi-scale patch-level data and execute WSI-level classification. We validate the proposed label-efficient method on a urine cytology WSI dataset encompassing 130 samples (13,000 patches) and FNAC 2019 dataset with 212 samples (21,200 patches). The experiment shows that the proposed LESS reaches 84.79%, 85.43%, 91.79% and 78.30% on a urine cytology WSI dataset, and 96.53%, 96.37%, 99.31%, 94.95% on FNAC 2019 dataset in terms of accuracy, AUC, sensitivity and specificity. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods and realizes automatic cytology-based bladder cancer screening.",

To address this long-range temporal problem with periodic nature, we propose a new approach (team IndRNN), an Independently Recurrent Neural Network (IndRNN) based long-term temporal activity recognition with spatial and frequency domain features. The data is first segmented into one second sliding windows, then temporal and frequency domain features are extracted as short-term temporal features. A deep IndRNN model is used to predict the unknown test dataset location. Under the predicted location, a deep IndRNN model is further used to classify the 8 activities with best performed features. Finally, transfer learning and model fusion are used to improve the result under the user-independence case. The proposed method achieves 86.94% accuracy on the validation set at the predicted location.",

            "abstract": "Smartphone-sensors-based human activity recognition is attracting increasing interest due to the popularization of smartphones. It is a difficult long-range temporal recognition problem, especially with large intraclass distances such as carrying smartphones at different locations and small interclass distances such as taking a train or subway. To address this problem, we propose a new framework of combining short-term spatial/frequency feature extraction and a long-term independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN) for activity recognition. Considering the periodic characteristics of the sensor data, short-term temporal features are first extracted in the spatial and frequency domains. Then, the IndRNN, which can capture long-term patterns, is used to further obtain the long-term features for classification. Given the large differences when the smartphone is carried at different locations, a group-based location recognition is first developed to pinpoint the location of the smartphone. The Sussex-Huawei Locomotion (SHL) dataset from the SHL Challenge is used for evaluation. An earlier version of the proposed method won the second place award in the SHL Challenge 2020 (first place if not considering the multiple models fusion approach). The proposed method is further improved in this paper and achieves 80.72% accuracy, better than the existing methods using a single model.",
