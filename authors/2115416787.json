            "title": "Geocomplexity explains spatial errors",
            "abstract": "Abstract The explanation of spatial errors in geospatial modelling has long been a challenge. This study introduces an index that captures the complexity of local spatial distribution, which can partially provide insight into spatial errors. While previous studies have explored the complexity of geographical data from various perspectives, there is limited knowledge on assessing the complexity while taking spatial dependence into account. This study proposes a measure of geocomplexity, i.e. the spatial local complexity indicator, which characterizes the complexity of local spatial patterns while considering spatial neighbor dependence. We used both aspatial and spatial models to estimate the economic inequality in Australia, and applied the spatial local complexity indicator to explain spatial errors in these models. Results show that the developed geocomplexity indicator, using a binary spatial matrix, can effectively explain spatial errors arising from models, including 17%-47% of errors in aspatial models and 14% in a spatial model. The experiments in this study support our hypothesis that geocomplexity is an essential component in explaining spatial errors. The proposed geocomplexity indicator, along with our hypothesis, has the potential for advancing the understanding complex geospatial systems and enabling applications in various fields related to spatial data analysis.",

            "title": "A generalized heterogeneity model for spatial interpolation",
            "abstract": "Abstract Spatial heterogeneity refers to uneven distributions of geographical variables. Spatial interpolation methods that utilize spatial heterogeneity are sensitive to the way in which spatial heterogeneity is characterized. This study developed a Generalized Heterogeneity Model (GHM) for characterizing local and stratified heterogeneity within variables and to improve interpolation accuracy. GHM first divides a study area into multiple spatial strata according to the sample values and locations of a variable. Then, GHM estimates simultaneously the spatial variations of the variable within and between the spatial strata. Finally, GHM interpolates unbiased estimates and uncertainty at unsampled locations. We demonstrated the GHM by predicting the spatial distributions of marine chlorophyll in Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Results show that GHM improved both the overall interpolation accuracy across the study area and along strata boundaries compared with previous interpolation models. GHM also avoided bull\u2019s eye patterns and abrupt changes along strata boundaries. In future studies, GHM has the potential to be integrated with machine learning and advanced algorithms to improve spatial prediction accuracy for studies in broader fields.",

            "abstract": "Data streams from sensors are widely used in many applications of ubiquitous computing environments. In particular, spatial data streams from sensors are useful in context-awareness for many types of applications. However, an important gap is found between spatial data stream management and spatial context-awareness. While spatial data streams from sensors should be handled in real-time, spatial context-awareness often requires complicated analysis and expensive processing cost. For this reason, it is difficult to integrate spatial data stream processing and context-awareness. In this paper, we present a system called SCONSTREAM (Spatial CONtext STREAm Management) that we have developed to resolve the gap between spatial data stream and context-awareness. The key approach of our system is to convert spatial data streams from sensors to spatial context streams, which are smaller and more suitable to be processed by the context-awareness module than raw data from sensors. By SCONSTREAM, we resolved the gap and achieved the integration of spatial data processing and spatial context-awareness module.",
