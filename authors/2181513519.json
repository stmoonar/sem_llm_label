            "title": "A Comprehensive Survey on Segment Anything Model for Vision and Beyond",
            "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving towards artificial general intelligence, which refers to the ability of an AI system to perform a wide range of tasks and exhibit a level of intelligence similar to that of a human being. This is in contrast to narrow or specialized AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks with a high degree of efficiency. Therefore, it is urgent to design a general class of models, which we term foundation models, trained on broad data that can be adapted to various downstream tasks. The recently proposed segment anything model (SAM) has made significant progress in breaking the boundaries of segmentation, greatly promoting the development of foundation models for computer vision. To fully comprehend SAM, we conduct a survey study. As the first to comprehensively review the progress of segmenting anything task for vision and beyond based on the foundation model of SAM, this work focuses on its applications to various tasks and data types by discussing its historical development, recent progress, and profound impact on broad applications. We first introduce the background and terminology for foundation models including SAM, as well as state-of-the-art methods contemporaneous with SAM that are significant for segmenting anything task. Then, we analyze and summarize the advantages and limitations of SAM across various image processing applications, including software scenes, real-world scenes, and complex scenes. Importantly, many insights are drawn to guide future research to develop more versatile foundation models and improve the architecture of SAM. We also summarize massive other amazing applications of SAM in vision and beyond. Finally, we maintain a continuously updated paper list and an open-source project summary for foundation model SAM at \\href{https://github.com/liliu-avril/Awesome-Segment-Anything}{\\color{magenta}{here}}.",

            "title": "AutoDenoise: Automatic Data Instance Denoising for Recommendations",
            "abstract": "Historical user-item interaction datasets are essential in training modern recommender systems for predicting user preferences. However, the arbitrary user behaviors in most recommendation scenarios lead to a large volume of noisy data instances being recorded, which cannot fully represent their true interests. While a large number of denoising studies are emerging in the recommender system community, all of them suffer from highly dynamic data distributions. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based framework, AutoDenoise, with an Instance Denoising Policy Network, for denoising data instances with an instance selection manner in deep recommender systems. To be specific, AutoDenoise serves as an agent in DRL to adaptively select noise-free and predictive data instances, which can then be utilized directly in training representative recommendation models. In addition, we design an alternate two-phase optimization strategy to train and validate the AutoDenoise properly. In the searching phase, we aim to train the policy network with the capacity of instance denoising; in the validation phase, we find out and evaluate the denoised subset of data instances selected by the trained policy network, so as to validate its denoising ability. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of AutoDenoise combined with multiple representative recommender system models.",

            "title": "AdaFS: Adaptive Feature Selection in Deep Recommender System",
            "abstract": "Feature selection plays an impactful role in deep recommender systems, which selects a subset of the most predictive features, so as to boost the recommendation performance and accelerate model optimization. The majority of existing feature selection methods, however, aim to select only a fixed subset of features. This setting cannot fit the dynamic and complex environments of practical recommender systems, where the contribution of a specific feature varies significantly across user-item interactions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive feature selection framework, AdaFS, for deep recommender systems. To be specific, we develop a novel controller network to automatically select the most relevant features from the whole feature space, which fits the dynamic recommendation environment better. Besides, different from classic feature selection approaches, the proposed controller can adaptively score each example of user-item interactions, and identify the most informative features correspondingly for subsequent recommendation tasks. We conduct extensive experiments based on two public benchmark datasets from a real-world recommender system. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaFS, and its excellent transferability to the most popular deep recommendation models.",
