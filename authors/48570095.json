            "title": "A Preliminary Study of ChatGPT on News Recommendation: Personalization, Provider Fairness, Fake News",
            "abstract": "Online news platforms commonly employ personalized news recommendation methods to assist users in discovering interesting articles, and many previous works have utilized language model techniques to capture user interests and understand news content. With the emergence of large language models like GPT-3 and T-5, a new recommendation paradigm has emerged, leveraging pre-trained language models for making recommendations. ChatGPT, with its user-friendly interface and growing popularity, has become a prominent choice for text-based tasks. Considering the growing reliance on ChatGPT for language tasks, the importance of news recommendation in addressing social issues, and the trend of using language models in recommendations, this study conducts an initial investigation of ChatGPT's performance in news recommendations, focusing on three perspectives: personalized news recommendation, news provider fairness, and fake news detection. ChatGPT has the limitation that its output is sensitive to the input phrasing. We therefore aim to explore the constraints present in the generated responses of ChatGPT for each perspective. Additionally, we investigate whether specific prompt formats can alleviate these constraints or if these limitations require further attention from researchers in the future. We also surpass fixed evaluations by developing a webpage to monitor ChatGPT's performance on weekly basis on the tasks and prompts we investigated. Our aim is to contribute to and encourage more researchers to engage in the study of enhancing news recommendation performance through the utilization of large language models such as ChatGPT.",

            "title": "PBNR: Prompt-based News Recommender System",
            "abstract": "Online news platforms often use personalized news recommendation methods to help users discover articles that align with their interests. These methods typically predict a matching score between a user and a candidate article to reflect the user's preference for the article. Some previous works have used language model techniques, such as the attention mechanism, to capture users' interests based on their past behaviors, and to understand the content of articles. However, these existing model architectures require adjustments if additional information is taken into account. Pre-trained large language models, which can better capture word relationships and comprehend contexts, have seen a significant development in recent years, and these pre-trained models have the advantages of transfer learning and reducing the training time for downstream tasks. Meanwhile, prompt learning is a newly developed technique that leverages pre-trained language models by building task-specific guidance for output generations. To leverage textual information in news articles, this paper introduces the pre-trained large language model and prompt-learning to the community of news recommendation. The proposed model\"prompt-based news recommendation\"(PBNR) treats the personalized news recommendation as a text-to-text language task and designs personalized prompts to adapt to the pre-trained language model -- text-to-text transfer transformer (T5). Experimental studies using the Microsoft News dataset show that PBNR is capable of making accurate recommendations by taking into account various lengths of past behaviors of different users. PBNR can also easily adapt to new information without changing the model architecture and the training objective. Additionally, PBNR can make recommendations based on users' specific requirements, allowing human-computer interaction in the news recommendation field.",

We use news story data from the McClatchy organization to establish benchmarks on how accurately stories can be classified by multiple existing deep learning classifiers. Among the models we evaluated, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) provides the best accuracy, macro-averaging precision, micro-averaging precision, macro-averaging recall and micro-averaging recall. Different from many other benchmark news data set, McClatchy provides both headline and full-text for each news story. We compare the performance of every deep learning-based classifier using headlines versus full-texts\u2014the top three predicted categories include the labeled value 95% of the time with full-texts training and 92% with headlines only. Furthermore, the defined topics in McClatchy are not mutually exclusive. Some predictions identified as inaccurate are in fact classified into reasonable topics. We further provide a visualization of stories from various defined topics. The predicted results and the visualization of news stories illustrate the untrustworthiness of labeled classes and the intrinsic difficulty of categorizing news stories.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays many restaurants adopt a new retailing strategy of buying online and picking up in store (BOPS) to offer diversified service efficiently. During the epidemic period of coronavirus, customers behave with infection risk aversion, leading to the alteration in consuming demands for the three ways (pure online, pure offline and BOPS). Therefore, this paper establishes two models to investigate the problem on how restaurants allocate service contributions between online and offline channels. Firstly, we build utility equations to classify consumers with heterogeneous perceptions of infection risk. Considering the trait of infection risk aversion, we can obtain consuming demands of different channels and the aggregate revenues. Then, the optimal service levels of both online and offline can be calculated, as well as the optimal profits. We find that BOPS can help restaurants increase profits by adjusting the service level of both online and offline channels even in the case of consumer risk aversion. Finally, we draw out numerical experiments to verify our findings.",

            "title": "Personalised Reranking of Paper Recommendations Using Paper Content and User Behavior",
            "abstract": "Academic search engines have been widely used to access academic papers, where users\u2019 information needs are explicitly represented as search queries. Some modern recommender systems have taken one step further by predicting users\u2019 information needs without the presence of an explicit query. In this article, we examine an academic paper recommender that sends out paper recommendations in email newsletters, based on the users\u2019 browsing history on the academic search engine. Specifically, we look at users who regularly browse papers on the search engine, and we sign up for the recommendation newsletters for the first time. We address the task of reranking the recommendation candidates that are generated by a production system for such users. We face the challenge that the users on whom we focus have not interacted with the recommender system before, which is a common scenario that every recommender system encounters when new users sign up. We propose an approach to reranking candidate recommendations that utilizes both paper content and user behavior. The approach is designed to suit the characteristics unique to our academic recommendation setting. For instance, content similarity measures can be used to find the closest match between candidate recommendations and the papers previously browsed by the user. To this end, we use a knowledge graph derived from paper metadata to compare entity similarities (papers, authors, and journals) in the embedding space. Since the users on whom we focus have no prior interactions with the recommender system, we propose a model to learn a mapping from users\u2019 browsed articles to user clicks on the recommendations. We combine both content and behavior into a hybrid reranking model that outperforms the production baseline significantly, providing a relative 13% increase in Mean Average Precision and 28% in Precision@1. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of the model components, highlighting where the performance boost comes from. The obtained insights reveal useful components for the reranking process and can be generalized to other academic recommendation settings as well, such as the utility of graph embedding similarity. Also, recent papers browsed by users provide stronger evidence for recommendation than historical ones.",

In this paper, we propose a topic-guided neural image captioning model which incorporates a topic model into the CNN-RNN framework. Our model represents each image as a set of topics and each topic as various words with relevant distributions. We conduct experiments on Microsoft COCO dataset. The results show that our model outperforms the baselines and achieves promising performance.
