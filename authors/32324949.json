            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

Federated learning (FL) enables multiple participants to develop a machine learning model without compromising the privacy and confidentiality of their data. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of different FL aggregation methods and compare them to central and local training approaches. Our study is based on four datasets with varying data distributions. The results indicate that the performance of FL is highly dependent on the data and its distribution among clients. In some scenarios, FL can be an effective alternative to traditional central or local training methods. Additionally, we introduce a new federated learning dataset from a real-world quality inspection setting.",

As data availability and computing power have increased, so has the popularity of deep learning from trajectory data.

We take a data-centric approach and distinguish between deep learning models trained using dense trajectories (quasi-continuous tracking data), sparse trajectories (such as check-in data), and aggregated trajectories (crowd information).",

            "abstract": "While the paths humans take play out in social as well as physical space, measures to describe and compare their trajectories are carried out in abstract, typically Euclidean, space. When these measures are applied to trajectories of actual individuals in an application area, alterations that are inconsequential in abstract space may suddenly become problematic once overlaid with geographic reality. In this work, we present a different view on trajectory similarity by introducing a measure that utilizes logical entailment. This is an inferential perspective that considers facts as triple statements deduced from the social and environmental context in which the travel takes place, and their practical implications. We suggest a formalization of entailment-based trajectory similarity, measured as the overlapping proportion of facts, which are spatial relation statements in our case study. With the proposed measure, we evaluate LSTM-TrajGAN, a privacy-preserving trajectory-generation model. The entailment-based model evaluation reveals potential consequences of disregarding the rich structure of geographic space (e.g., miscalculated insurance risk due to regional shifts in our toy example). Our work highlights the advantage of applying logical entailment to trajectory-similarity reasoning for location-privacy protection and beyond.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Movement datasets are often complex and require sophisticated processing and analysis. A thorough understanding of the dataset is needed to choose the right methods and to interpret their results. Misunderstandings and violations of assumptions about dataset characteristics can lead to flawed analysis results and wrong conclusions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel protocol for the systematic exploration of movement datasets. The individual protocol steps address the different types of movement data problems. The exploration tools recommended at each step are specifically tailored to identifying potential problems and avoiding common pitfalls when working with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) tracking data, commonly referred to as GPS tracks. However, the general steps should be transferable to continuous movement datasets with different characteristics, such as video trajectories. Furthermore, we provide an open-source implementation of our protocol in the form of a Jupyter notebook accompanying this paper.",

            "abstract": "Pressing issues related to the movement of people and goods can be tackled today thanks to improvements in tracking and communications technology that have made it possible to collect movement data on a big scale. Maritime data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) is one of the fast growing sources of movement data. Existing approaches for AIS data analysis suffer from scalability issues. Therefore, scalable distributed modelling and analysis approaches are needed. This paper presents a novel scalable movement data model that takes advantage of an adaptive grid based on quad trees. Our data model supports anomaly detection in massive movement data streams by combining advantages of both grid and vector-based approaches. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach for anomaly detection in AIS datasets comprising 560 million location records.",

            "abstract": "Extracting useful information from large spatiotemporal datasets is a challenging task that requires suitable visual data representations. Big movement data are particularly hard to visualize since they are prone to visual clutter caused by overlapping and crisscrossing trajectories. Different data aggregation approaches have been developed to address this challenge and to provide analysts with better visualizations for data exploration and datadriven hypothesis generation. However, most approaches for extracting patterns, such as mobility graphs or generalized flow maps, cannot handle large input datasets. This paper presents a flow extraction algorithm that can be used in distributed computing environments and thus make it possible to explore movement patterns in large datasets. We demonstrate its usefulness in a use case exploring maritime vessel movements",
