            "abstract": "The role of uncertainty in data management has become more prominent than ever before, especially because of the growing importance of machine learning-driven applications that produce large uncertain databases. A well-known approach to querying such databases is to blend rule-based reasoning with uncertainty. However, techniques proposed so far struggle with large databases. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting a new technique for probabilistic reasoning that exploits Trigger Graphs (TGs) -- a notion recently introduced for the non-probabilistic setting. The intuition is that TGs can effectively store a probabilistic model by avoiding an explicit materialization of the lineage and by grouping together similar derivations of the same fact. Firstly, we show how TGs can be adapted to support the possible world semantics. Then, we describe techniques for efficiently computing a probabilistic model and formally establish the correctness of our approach. We also present an extensive empirical evaluation using a prototype called LTGs. Our comparison against other leading engines shows that LTGs is not only faster, even against approximate reasoning techniques, but can also reason over probabilistic databases that existing engines cannot scale to.",

            "abstract": "We study reasoning with existential rules to perform query answering over streams of data. On static databases, this problem has been widely studied, but its extension to rapidly changing data has not yet been considered. To bridge this gap, we extend LARS, a well-known framework for rule-based stream reasoning, to support existential rules. For that, we show how to translate LARS with existentials into a semantics-preserving set of existential rules. As query answering with such rules is undecidable in general, we describe how to leverage the temporal nature of streams and present suitable notions of acyclicity that ensure decidability.",

Although these architectures deliver impressive results, their level is not yet comparable to the one of humans and they might produce errors that have a significant impact on the downstream task (e.g., fact-checking). To improve the performance, we present a new neural architecture where the input also includes automatically generated negated perspectives over a given claim. The model is jointly learned to make simultaneously multiple predictions, which can be used either to improve the classification of the original perspective or to filter out doubtful predictions. In the first case, we propose a weakly supervised method for combining the predictions into a final one. In the second case, we show that using the confidence scores to remove doubtful predictions allows our method to achieve human-like performance over the retained information, which is still a sizable part of the original input.",

A general problem of chase algorithms is that they might perform redundant computations. To counter this problem, we introduce the notion ofTrigger Graphs(TGs), which guide the execution of the rules avoiding redundant computations. We present the results of an extensive theoretical and empirical study that seeks to answer when and how TGs can be computed and what are the benefits of TGs when applied over real-world KBs. Our results include introducing algorithms that compute (minimal) TGs. We implemented our approach in a new engine, called GLog, and our experiments show that it can be significantly more efficient than the chase enabling us to materialize Knowledge Graphs with 17B facts in less than 40 min using a single machine with commodity hardware.",

            "abstract": "Tables in Wikipedia articles contain a wealth of knowledge that would be useful for many applications if it were structured in a more coherent, queryable form. An important problem is that many of such tables contain the same type of knowledge, but have different layouts and/or schemata. Moreover, some tables refer to entities that we can link to Knowledge Bases (KBs), while others do not. Finally, some tables express entity-attribute relations, while others contain more complex n-ary relations. We propose a novel knowledge extraction technique that tackles these problems. Our method first transforms and clusters similar tables into fewer unified ones to overcome the problem of table diversity. Then, the unified tables are linked to the KB so that knowledge about popular entities propagates to the unpopular ones. Finally, our method applies a technique that relies on functional dependencies to judiciously interpret the table and extract n-ary relations. Our experiments over 1.5M Wikipedia tables show that our clustering can group many semantically similar tables. This leads to the extraction of many novel n-ary relations.",

Our technique first creates embeddings of subgraphs using the embeddings from the model. Then, it ranks the subgraphs with some proposed ranking functions and considers only the entities in the top k subgraphs.

For some queries, executing a rewriting procedure like MS is the best choice, but for others a non-rewriting procedure like Query-subquery (QSQ) can be faster. Choosing beforehand which procedure should be used is not trivial and mistakes can be costly. To address this problem, we describe a first-of-its-kind method that builds a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict whether a query should be answered with MS or with QSQ. Experiments on several well-known KGs show that our method can return accurate predictions, and this leads to a significant reduction of the response time of query answering.",
