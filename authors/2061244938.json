            "title": "The Death and Life of Great Italian Cities: A Mobile Phone Data Perspective",
            "abstract": "The Death and Life of Great American Cities was written in 1961 and is now one of the most influential book in city planning. In it, Jane Jacobs proposed four conditions that promote life in a city. However, these conditions have not been empirically tested until recently. This is mainly because it is hard to collect data about \"city life\". The city of Seoul recently collected pedestrian activity through surveys at an unprecedented scale, with an effort spanning more than a decade, allowing researchers to conduct the first study successfully testing Jacobs's conditions. In this paper, we identify a valuable alternative to the lengthy and costly collection of activity survey data: mobile phone data. We extract human activity from such data, collect land use and socio-demographic information from the Italian Census and Open Street Map, and test the four conditions in six Italian cities. Although these cities are very different from the places for which Jacobs's conditions were spelled out (i.e., great American cities) and from the places in which they were recently tested (i.e., the Asian city of Seoul), we find those conditions to be indeed associated with urban life in Italy as well. Our methodology promises to have a great impact on urban studies, not least because, if replicated, it will make it possible to test Jacobs's theories at scale.",

            "abstract": "The authors' CitySensing system captures at places social media streams and anonymous Call Data Records (CDR) during city-scale events. It semantically annotates the social media streams before fusing it with privacy-preserving aggregates of CDR. The result is analysed and repurposed to feed a public installation where visual story telling assumes a leading role in allowing the audience to perceive emerging patterns and to observe their dynamics. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of the visualization on the real-world data of two editions of Milan Design Week. This article is part of a special issue on social multimedia and storytelling.",

The lab is located in Trento which hosts one of the 6 Information and Communication Technologies Lab of the EIT and two reference research groups: University of Trento and the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) center. The aim of the lab is to exploit the potential of big data and open data by creating a platform to share data among academia, industrial and institutional partners. It is our belief that such raw data gives a new image of the territory/community from which the data was collected and by analyzing it new trends, enriched information can be extracted. The results of the analysis can turn into revenue and profit not only for the companies but also for the communities.",

            "abstract": "The pervasiveness of mobile phones creates an unprecedented opportunity for analyzing human dynamics with the help of the data they generate. This enables a novel human-driven approach for service creation in a variety of domains (e.g., healthcare, transportation, etc.) Telecom operators own and manage billions of mobile network events (Call Detailed Records - CDRs) per day: interpreting such a big stream of data needs a deep understanding of the events' context through the available background knowledge. We introduce an ontological and stochastic model (HRBModel) to interpret mobile human behavior using merged mobile network data and the geo-referenced background knowledge (e.g., OpenStreetMap, etc.) The model characterizes locations with human activities that can happen (with a given likelihood) there. This allows us to predicatively compile sets of tasks that people are likely to engage in under certain contextual conditions or to characterize exceptional events detected from anomalies in the CDR. An experimental evaluation of the approach is presented.",
