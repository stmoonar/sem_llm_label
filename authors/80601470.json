            "title": "Learning from Imbalanced Crowdsourced Labeled Data",
            "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has proven to be a cost-e\ufb00ective way to meet the demands for labeled training data in supervised deep learning models. However, crowdsourced labels are often inconsistent and noisy due to cognitive and expertise di\ufb00erences among crowd workers. Existing approaches either infer latent true labels from noisy crowdsourced labels or learn a discriminative model directly from the crowdsourced labeled data, assuming the latent true label distribution is class-balanced. Unfortunately, in many real-world applications, the true label distribution typically is imbalanced across classes. Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem of learning from crowdsourced labeled data with an imbalanced true label distribution. We propose a new framework, named \u201cLearning from Imbalanced Crowdsourced Labeled Data\u201d (ICED), which simultaneously infers true labels from imbalanced crowdsourced labeled data and achieves high accuracy on downstream tasks such as classi\ufb01cation. The ICED framework consists of two modules, i.e., a true label inference module and a synthetic data generation module, that augment each other iteratively. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the e\ufb00ectiveness of the ICED framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/wentao-repo/ICED .",

            "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has emerged as a popular approach for collecting annotated data to train supervised machine learning models. However, annotator bias can lead to defective annotations. Though there are a few works investigating individual annotator bias, the group effects in annotators are largely overlooked. In this work, we reveal that annotators within the same demographic group tend to show consistent group bias in annotation tasks and thus we conduct an initial study on annotator group bias. We first empirically verify the existence of annotator group bias in various real-world crowdsourcing datasets. Then, we develop a novel probabilistic graphical framework GroupAnno to capture annotator group bias with an extended Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in modeling annotator group bias in label aggregation and model learning over competitive baselines.",

            "abstract": "\n This paper performs an observational human subjects study to investigate how design teams use an information system to exchange, store, and synthesize information in an engineering design task. Framed through the lens of decision-based design, a surrogate design task models an aircraft design problem with 12 design parameters across four roles and six system-level functional requirements. A virtual design studio provides a browser-based interface for four participants in a 30-min design session. Data collected across 10 design sessions provide process factors about communication patterns and outcome factors about the resulting design. Correlation analysis shows a positive relationship between design iteration and outcome performance but a negative relationship between chat messages and outcome performance. Discussion explains how advances in information exchange, storage, and synthesis can support future design activities.",

            "abstract": "With the increasing interest in using open innovation and crowdsourcing contests for engineering design, there is a need for understanding how different types of contests affect the outcomes. While contests have been studied in the economics literature, the analytical models are based on various simplifying assumptions. There is a lack of critical analysis of these assumptions, which is necessary before utilizing the insights from the models in a design context. In this paper, we address this gap by critically analyzing contest models for engineering design scenarios.",

            "abstract": "We propose a model for the airlines\u2019 decisions on route planning, i.e., the decision on selecting which route to add and delete, using discrete choice random-utility theory. The central hypothesis is that a discrete choice model can effectively model the airlines\u2019 decisions on route selection , and thereby help model the evolution of the air transportation network. We first model the airlines\u2019 utility function as a linear function of decision variables with interaction effects. The decision of route selection is then modeled using a binary choice model derived from the utility function. The preferences for each variable in the utility function are estimated using historical datasets. Advantages of this approach include the ability to use statistical techniques to quantitatively construct decision models as well as to account for the uncertainty in unobserved attributes of the decision model. The proposed model helps predict the airlines\u2019 decisions on routes addition and deletion which affect the network topology of air transportation and its future evolution. This capability can be beneficial to other stakeholders, such as Federal Aviation Administration, who may need to make their decisions in response to those made by the airlines, but do not have access to the airlines\u2019 true decision models.",
