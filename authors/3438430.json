            "abstract": "CG:SHOP is an annual geometric optimization challenge and the 2022 edition proposed the problem of coloring a certain geometric graph defined by line segments. Surprisingly, the top three teams used the same technique, called conflict optimization. This technique has been introduced in the 2021 edition of the challenge, to solve a coordinated motion planning problem. In this article, we present the technique in the more general framework of binary constraint satisfaction problems (binary CSP). Then, the top three teams describe their different implementations of the same underlying strategy. We evaluate the performance of those implementations to vertex color not only geometric graphs, but also other types of graphs.",

            "abstract": "Private permissioned blockchains are becoming gradually more sought-after. Such systems are reachable by authorized users, and tend to be completely transparent to whoever interacts with the blockchain. In this paper, we mitigate the latter. Authorized users can now stay unlinked to the transaction they propose in the blockchain while being authenticated before being allowed to interact. As a first contribution, we developed a consensus algorithm for private permissioned blockchains based on Hyperledger Fabric and the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus. Building on this blockchain, five additional variations achieving various client-wise privacy preserving levels are proposed. These different protocols allow for different use cases and levels of privacy control and sometimes its revocation by an authority. All our protocols guarantee the unlinkability of transactions to their issuers achieving anonymity or pseudonymity. Miners can also inherit some of the above privacy preserving setting. Naturally, we maintain liveness and safety of the system and its data.",

            "abstract": "The verification of computations performed by an untrusted server is a cornerstone for delegated computations, especially in multi-clients setting where inputs are provided by different parties. Assuming a common secret between clients, a garbled circuit offers the attractive property to ensure the correctness of a result computed by the untrusted server while keeping the input and the function private. Yet, this verification can be guaranteed only once. Based on the notion of multi-key homomorphic encryption (MKHE), we propose RMC-PVC a multi-client verifiable computation protocol, able to verify the correctness of computations performed by an untrusted server for inputs (encoded for a garbled circuit) provided by multiple clients. Thanks to MKHE, the garbled circuit is reusable an arbitrary number of times. In addition, each client can verify the computation by its own. Compared to a single-key FHE scheme, the MKHE usage in RMC-PVC allows to reduce the workload of the server and thus the response delay for the client. It also enforce the privacy of inputs, which are provided by different clients.",

            "title": "The Calissons Puzzle",
            "abstract": "In 2022, Olivier Longuet, a French mathematics teacher, created a game called the \\textit{calissons puzzle}. Given a triangular grid in a hexagon and some given edges of the grid, the problem is to find a calisson tiling such that no input edge is overlapped and calissons adjacent to an input edge have different orientations. We extend the puzzle to regions $R$ that are not necessarily hexagonal. The first interesting property of this puzzle is that, unlike the usual calisson or domino problems, it is solved neither by a maximal matching algorithm, nor by Thurston's algorithm. This raises the question of its complexity. We prove that if the region $R$ is finite and simply connected, then the puzzle can be solved by an algorithm that we call the \\textit{advancing surface algorithm} and whose complexity is $O(|\\partial R|^3)$ where $\\partial R|$ is the size of the boundary of the region $R$. In the case where the region is the entire infinite triangular grid, we prove that the existence of a solution can be solved with an algorithm of complexity $O(|X|^3)$ where $X$ is the set of input edges. To prove these theorems, we revisit William Thurston's results on the calisson tilability of a region $R$. The solutions involve equivalence between calisson tilings, stepped surfaces and certain DAG cuts that avoid passing through a set of edges that we call \\textit{unbreakable}. It allows us to generalize Thurston's theorem characterizing tilable regions by rewriting it in terms of descending paths or absorbing cycles. Thurston's algorithm appears as a distance calculation algorithm following Dijkstra's paradigm. The introduction of a set $X$ of interior edges introduces negative weights that force a Bellman-Ford strategy to be preferred. These results extend Thurston's legacy by using computer science structures and algorithms.",

            "abstract": "The stochastic multi-armed bandit is a classical reinforcement learning model, where a learning agent sequentially chooses an action (pull a bandit arm) and the environment responds with a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown distribution associated with the chosen action. A popular objective for the agent is to identify the arm having the maximum expected reward, also known as the best arm identification problem. We address the security concerns that occur in a cross-silo federated learning setting, where multiple data owners collaborate under the orchestration of a server to execute a best arm identification algorithm. We propose three secure protocols, which guarantee desirable security properties for the: input data (i.e., reward values), intermediate data (i.e., sums of rewards), and output data (i.e., ranking of arms and in particular the identified best arm). More precisely: (1) no data owner can learn the identified best arm; moreover, no data owner can learn local data pertaining to another data owner; (2) the orchestration participants cannot learn the identified best arm, any reward value, or any sum of rewards; (3) by analyzing the messages exchanged over the network, an external observer cannot learn the identified best arm, or any reward value, or any sum of rewards. Each protocol has a different architecture, uses different techniques, and proposes a different trade-off with respect to several criteria that we thoroughly analyze: number of participants, generality of the supported reward functions, cryptographic overhead, and communication cost. To build our protocols, we rely on secure multi-party computation, AES-CBC, and the additive homomorphic property of Paillier.",

            "abstract": ". In 1986, A.Yao introduced the notion of garbled circuits , designed to verify the correctness of computations performed on an un-trusted server. However, correctness is guaranteed for only one input, meaning that a new garbled circuit must be created for each new input. To address this drawback, in 2010 Gennaro et al. performed the evaluation of the garbled circuit homomorphically using Fully Homomorphic Encryption scheme, allowing to reuse the same garbled circuit for new inputs. Their solution requires to encrypt the garbled circuit at every new input. In this paper, we propose a veri\ufb01able-computation scheme allowing to verify the correctness of computations performed by an untrusted server for multiple inputs, where the garbled circuit is homomorphically encrypted only once. Hence, we have a faster scheme comparing to Gen-naro\u2019s solution, since for each new input, we reduce the computations by the size of the circuit representing the function to be computed, for the same security level. The key point to obtain this speed-up is to rely on Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption ( MKHE ) and then to encrypt only once the garbled circuit.",

            "abstract": ". Recent works to improve privacy and auditability in permissioned blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric rely on Idemix, the only anonymous credential system that has been integrated to date. The current Idemix implementation in Hyperledger Fabric (v2.4) only supports a fixed set of attributes, it does not support revocation features, nor does it support anonymous endorsement of transactions (in Fabric, transactions need to be approved by a subset of peers before consensus). A prototype Idemix extension by Bogatov et al. (CANS, 2021) was proposed to include revocation, auditability, and to gain privacy for users. We explore how to gain e\ufb00iciency, functionality, and further privacy departing from recent works on anonymous credentials based on Structure-Preserving Signatures on Equivalence Classes. As a result, we propose Protego and Protego Duo, two alternatives for Idemix and its recent extensions. We discuss how they can be used in the permissioned blockchain setting and integrated to Hyper-ledger Fabric. We also provide a prototype implementation and benchmarks showing that both alternatives are twice as fast as state-of-the-art-approaches.",

            "abstract": "Secure messaging applications are deployed on devices that can be compromised, lost, stolen, or corrupted in many ways. Thus, recovering from attacks to get back to a clean state is essential and known as healing. Signal is a widely-known, privacy-friendly messaging application, that uses key-ratcheting mechanism updates keys at each stage to provide end-to-end channel security, forward secrecy, and post-compromise security. We strengthen this last property, by providing a faster healing. Signal needs up to two full chains of messages before recovering, our protocol enables recovery after the equivalent of a chain of only one message. We also provide an extra protection against session-hijacking attacks. We do so, while building on the pre-existing Signal backbone, without weakening its other security assumptions, and still being compatible with Signal's out-of-order message handling feature. Our implementation results show that, while slower than Signal (as expected), MARSHAL's spectacular gain in healing speed comes at a surprisingly low cost, with individual stages (including key-derivation, encryption, and decryption) taking less than 6 ms.",

An attractive property, especially in view of Snowden\u2019s revelation of mass-surveillance, PCS was pioneered by the Signal messaging protocol, and is present in OTR. In this paper, we introduce a framework for quantifying and comparing PCS security, with respect to a broad taxonomy of adversaries. The generality and flexibility of our approach allows us to model the healing speed of a broad class of protocols, including Signal, but also an identity-based messaging protocol named SAID, and even a composition of 5G handover protocols.",

Beedroid swarms will be deployed in cuboid-shaped greenhouse. Each beedroid swarm will have to indefinitely search for flowers to pollinate in its greenhouse. We model this problem as a perpetual exploration of a 3D grid by a swarm of beedroids. In this paper, we propose two optimal solutions to solve this problem and so to save humanity.",

Assuming a common secret between clients, a garbled circuit offers the attractive property to ensure the correctness of a result computed by the untrusted server while keeping the input and the function private. Yet, this verification can be guaranteed only once . Basedonthenotion of multi-keyhomomorphicencryption ( MKHE ), we propose RMC - PVC a multi-client verifiable computation protocol, able to verify the correctness of computations performed by an untrusted server for inputs (encoded for a garbled circuit) provided by multiple clients. Thanks to MKHE , the garbled circuit is reusable an arbitrary number of times. In addition, each client can verify the computation by its own. Compared to a single-key FHE scheme, the MKHE usage in RMC - PVC allows to reduce the workload of the server and thus the response delay for the client. It also enforce the privacy of inputs, which are provided by different clients.",

We address the security concerns that occur when data and computations are outsourced to an honest-but-curious cloud i.e., that executes tasks dutifully, but tries to gain as much information as possible. We consider situations where data used in bandit algorithms is sensitive and has to be protected e.g., commercial or personal data. We rely on cryptographic schemes and propose UCB - MS, a secure multi-party protocol based on the UCB algorithm. We prove that UCB - MS computes the same cumulative reward as UCB while satisfying desirable security properties. In particular, cloud nodes cannot learn the cumulative reward or the sum of rewards for more than one arm. Moreover, by analyzing messages exchanged among cloud nodes, an external observer cannot learn the cumulative reward or the sum of rewards produced by some arm. We show that the overhead due to cryptographic primitives is linear in the size of the input. Our implementation confirms the linear-time behavior and the practical feasibility of our protocol, on both synthetic and real-world data.",

            "abstract": "Biometric recognition encompasses two operating modes. The first one is biometric identification which consists in determining the identity of an individual based on her biometrics and requires browsing the entire database (i.e., a 1:N search). The other one is biometric authentication which corresponds to verifying claimed biometrics of an individual (i.e., a 1:1 search) to authenticate her, or grant her access to some services. The matching process is based on the similarities between a fresh and an enrolled biometric template. Considering the case of binary templates, we investigate how a highly populated database yields near-collisions, impacting the security of both the operating modes. Insight into the security of binary templates is given by establishing a lower bound on the size of templates and an upper bound on the size of a template database depending on security parameters. We provide efficient algorithms for partitioning a leaked template database in order to improve the generation of a master-template-set that can impersonates any enrolled user and possibly some future users. Practical impacts of proposed algorithms are finally emphasized with experimental studies.",

This type of transformation is constructed as a composition of a biometric transformation with a feature extraction algorithm. The security requirements of cancelable biometric schemes concern the irreversibility, unlinkability and revocability of templates, without losing in accuracy of comparison. While several schemes were recently attacked regarding these requirements, full reversibility of such a composition in order to produce colliding biometric characteristics, and specifically presentation attacks, were never demonstrated to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we formalize these attacks for a traditional cancelable scheme with the help of integer linear programming (ILP) and quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP). Solving these optimization problems allows an adversary to slightly alter its fingerprint image in order to impersonate any individual. Moreover, in an even more severe scenario, it is possible to simultaneously impersonate several individuals.",

            "abstract": "When designing a new symmetric block cipher, it is necessary to evaluate its robustness against differential attacks. This is done by computing Truncated Differential Characteristics (TDCs) that provide bounds on the complexity of these attacks. TDCs are often computed by using declarative approaches such as CP (Constraint Programming), SAT, or ILP (Integer Linear Programming). However, designing accurate and efficient models for these solvers is a difficult, error-prone and time-consuming task, and it requires advanced skills on both symmetric cryptography and solvers. In this paper, we describe a tool for automatically generating these models, called Tagada (Tool for Automatic Generation of Abstraction-based Differential Attacks). The input of Tagada is an operational description of the cipher by means of black-box operators and bipartite Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Given this description, we show how to automatically generate constraints that model operator semantics, and how to generate MiniZinc models. We experimentally evaluate our approach on two different kinds of differential attacks (e.g., single-key and related-key) and four different symmetric block ciphers (e.g., the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), Craft, Midori, and Skinny). We show that our automatically generated models are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. These automatically generated models constitute a new benchmark composed of eight optimization problems and eight enumeration problems, with instances of increasing size in each problem. We experimentally compare CP, SAT, and ILP solvers on this new benchmark. 2012 ACM",

We address the security concerns that occur when data and computations are outsourced to an honest-but-curious cloud i.e., that executes tasks dutifully, but tries to gain as much information as possible. We consider situations where data used in bandit algorithms is sensitive and has to be protected e.g., commercial or personal data. We rely on cryptographic schemes and propose UCB-DS, a distributed and secure protocol based on the UCB algorithm. We prove that UCB-DS computes the same cumulative reward as UCB while satisfying desirable security properties. In particular, cloud nodes cannot learn the cumulative reward or the sum of rewards for more than one arm. Moreover, by analyzing messages exchanged among cloud nodes, an external observer cannot learn the cumulative reward or the sum of rewards produced by some arm. We show that the overhead due to cryptographic primitives is linear in the size of the input. Our implementation confirms the linear-time behavior and the practical feasibility of our protocol, on both synthetic and real-world data.",

Liu and Shamir also claimed that the minimal solution using physical locks is clearly impractical and exponential in the number of participants. In this paper we relax some implicit assumptions in their claim and propose an optimal physical solution to the problem of Liu that uses physical padlocks, but the number of padlocks is not greater than the number of participants. Then, we show that no device can do better for k-out-of-n threshold padlock systems as soon as k \u2a7e 2 n , which holds true in particular for Liu\u2019s example. More generally, we derive bounds required to implement any threshold system and prove a lower bound of O ( log ( n ) ) padlocks for any threshold larger than 2. For instance we propose an optimal scheme reaching that bound for 2-out-of-n threshold systems and requiring less than 2 log 2 ( n ) padlocks. We also discuss more complex access structures, a wrapping technique, and other sublinear realizations like an algorithm to generate 3-out-of-n systems with 2.5 n padlocks. Finally we give an algorithm building k-out-of-n threshold padlock systems with only O ( log ( n ) k \u2212 1 ) padlocks. Apart from the physical world, our results also show that it is possible to implement secret sharing over small fields.",

A new generation of autonomous mobile robots, called M2C (for Melomaniac Myopic Chameleon), have been designed to find water on Poleless. To address this problem, we investigate optimal (w.r.t., visibility range and number of used colors) solutions to the infinite grid exploration problem (IGE) by a small team of M2C robots. Our first result shows that minimizing the visibility range and the number of used colors are two orthogonal issues: it is impossible to design a solution to the IGE problem that is optimal w.r.t. both parameters simultaneously. Consequently, we address optimality of these two criteria separately by proposing two algorithms; the former being optimal in terms of visibility range, the latter being optimal in terms of number of used colors. It is worth noticing that these two algorithms use a very small number of robots, respectively six and eight. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation \u2192 Distributed algorithms",

Hence, a natural approach is to design parallel algorithms that are executed on a cluster of machines rented from a public cloud provider. Intersection of relations becomes even more difficult when each relation belongs to a different data owner that wants to protect her data privacy. We consider the popular MapReduce paradigm for outsourcing data and computations to a semi-honest public cloud. Our main contribution is the SI protocol (for Secure Intersection) that allows to securely compute the intersection of an arbitrary number of relations, each of them being encrypted by its owner. The user allowed to query the intersection result has only to decrypt the result sent by the public cloud. SI does not leak (to the public cloud or to the user) any information on tuples that are not in the final relation intersection result, even if t he public cloud and the user collude i.e., they share all their private information. We prove the security of SI and provide an empirical evaluation showing its efficiency.",

We first show that two robots are not sufficient in our settings to solve the problem, even when robots have a common coordinate system. We then show that if the robots' coordinate systems are not self-consistent, three or four robots are not sufficient to solve the problem neither. Finally, we present three algorithms that solve the IGE problem in various settings. The first algorithm uses six robots with constant colors and a visibility range of one. The second one uses the minimum number of robots, i.e., five, as well as five modifiable colors, still under visibility one. The last algorithm requires seven oblivious anonymous robots, yet assuming visibility two. Notice that the two last algorithms also achieve exclusiveness.",

            "abstract": "Cloud storage provides an attractive solution for many organizations and enterprises due to its features such as scalability, availability and reduced costs. However, storing data in the cloud is challenging if we want to ensure data security and user privacy. To address these security issues cryptographic protocols are usually used. Such protocols rely on cryptographic primitives which have to guarantee some security properties such that data and user privacy or authentication. Attribute-Based Signature (ABS) and Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) are very adapted for storing data on an untrusted remote entity. In this work, we enhance the security of cloud storage systems through a formal analysis of a cloud storage protocol based on ABS and ABE schemes. We clarify several ambiguities in the design of this protocol and model the protocol and its security properties with ProVerif an automatic tool for the verification of cryptographic protocols. We discover an unknown attack against user privacy in the Ruj et al. protocol. We propose a correction, and automatically prove the security of the corrected protocol with ProVerif.",

            "abstract": "Industrial systems are nowadays regularly the target of cyberattacks, the most famous being Stuxnet. At the same time such systems are increasingly interconnected with other systems and insecure media such as Internet. In contrast to other IT systems, industrial systems often do not only require classical properties like data confidentiality or authentication of the communication, but have special needs due to their interaction with physical world. For example, the reordering or deletion of some commands sent to a machine can cause the system to enter an unsafe state with potentially catastrophic effects. To prevent such attacks, the integrity of the message flow is necessary. We provide a formal definition of Flow Integrity. We apply our definitions to two well-known industrial protocols: OPC-UA and MODBUS. Using TAMARIN, a cryptographic protocol verification tool, we confirm that most of the secure modes of these protocols ensure Flow Integrity given a resilient network. However, we also identify weaknesses in a supposedly secure version of MODBUS, as well as subtleties in the handling of sequence numbers in OPC-UA. We also practically examine an OPC-UA stack named python-opcua, where some of the subtleties are not handled correctly.",

In this paper, we examine the complexity of different authentication methods specifically designed for such devices. We study the widely spread technology to authenticate a user using a Personal Identifier Number code (PIN code). Entering the code is a critical moment where there are several possibilities for an attacker to discover the secret. We consider the three attack models: a Bruteforce Attack (BA) model, a Smudge Attack (SA) model, and an Observation Attack (OA) model where the attacker sees the user logging in on his device. The aim of the intruder is to learn the secret code. Our goal is to propose alternative methods to enter a PIN code. We compare such different methods in terms of security. Some methods require more intentional resources than other, this is why we performed a psychological study on the different methods to evaluate the users' perception of the different methods and their usage.",

To that end, the members of the group form conspiracies, to decide on appropriate gifts, and usually divide the cost of each gift among all participants of that conspiracy. This requires to settle the shared expenses per conspiracy, so Conspiracy Santa can actually be seen as an aggregation of several shared expenses problems.\nFirst, we show that the problem of finding a minimal number of transaction when settling shared expenses is NP-complete. Still, there exists good greedy approximations. Second, we present a greedy distributed secure solution to Conspiracy Santa. This solution allows a group of people to share the expenses for the gifts in such a way that no participant learns the price of his gift, but at the same time notably reduces the number of transactions with respect to a naive aggregation. Furthermore, our solution does not require a trusted third party, and can either be implemented physically (the participants are in the same room and exchange money using envelopes) or, virtually, using a cryptocurrency.",

Distance-bounding protocols are a countermeasure to relay attacks, whereby a verifier measures the round-trip time in exchanges with a prover. Inspired by application-security definitions, we propose a new security model, OracleDB, distinguishing two prover-corruption types: black-box and white-box. We use this distinction to settle the long-lasting arguments about terrorist-fraud resistance, by showing that it is irrelevant in both the black-box and white-box corruption models. We then exhibit a security flaw in the PayPass protocol with relay protection, used in EMV contactless payments. We propose an extension to this industry-standard protocol, with only small modifications, and prove its security in our strongest adversary model. Finally, we exhibit a new generalised distance-fraud attack strategy that defeats the security claims of at least 12 existing distance-bounding protocols.",

However, HB+ is vulnerable to a key-recovery, man-in-the-middle (MiM) attack dubbed GRS. The HB+DB protocol added a distance-bounding dimension to HB+, and was experimentally proven to resist the GRS attack. We exhibit several security flaws in HB+DB. First, we refine the GRS strategy to induce a different key-recovery MiM attack, not deterred by HB+DB's distancebounding. Second, we prove HB+DB impractical as a secure distance-bounding (DB) protocol, as its DB security-levels scale poorly compared to other DB protocols. Third, we refute that HB+DB's security against passive attackers relies on the hardness of LPN; moreover, (erroneously) requiring such hardness lowers HB+DB's efficiency and security. We also propose anew distance-bounding protocol called BLOG. It retains parts of HB+DB, yet BLOG is provably secure and enjoys better (asymptotical) security.",

            "abstract": "Distance-bounding protocols have been introduced to thwart relay attacks against contactless authentication protocols. In this context, verifiers have to authenticate the credentials of untrusted provers. Unfortunately, these protocols are themselves subject to complex threats such as terrorist-fraud attacks, in which a malicious prover helps an accomplice to authenticate. Provably guaranteeing the resistance of distance-bounding protocols to these attacks is complex. The classical solutions assume that rational provers want to protect their long-term authentication credentials, even with respect to their accomplices. Thus, terrorist-fraud resistant protocols generally rely on artificial extraction mechanisms, ensuring that an accomplice can retrieve the credential of his partnering prover, if he is able to authenticate. We propose a novel approach to obtain provable terrorist-fraud resistant protocols that does not rely on an accomplice being able to extract any long-term key. Instead, we simply assume that he can replay the information received from the prover. Thus, rational provers should refuse to cooperate with third parties if they can impersonate them freely afterwards. We introduce a generic construction for provably secure distance-bounding protocols, and give three instances of this construction: (1) an efficient symmetric-key protocol, (2) a public-key protocol protecting the identities of provers against external eavesdroppers, and finally (3) a fully anonymous protocol protecting the identities of provers even against malicious verifiers that try to profile them.",

            "abstract": "Symmetric Searchable Encryption (SSE) schemes solve efficiently the problem of securely outsourcing client data with search functionality. These schemes are provably secure with respect to an explicit leakage profile; however, determining how much information can be inferred in practice from this leakage remains difficult. First, we recall the leakage hierarchy introduced in 2015 by Cash et al. Second, we present complete practical attacks on SSE schemes of L4, L3 and L2 leakage profiles which are deployed in commercial cloud solutions. Our attacks are passive and only assume the knowledge of a small sample of plaintexts. Moreover, we show their devastating effect on real-world data sets since, regardless of the leakage profile, an adversary knowing a mere 1% of the document set is able to retrieve 90% of documents whose content is revealed over 70%. Then, we further extend the analysis of existing attacks to highlight the gap of security that exists between L2- and L1-SSE and give some simple countermeasures to prevent our attacks.",

A ZK-PRI allows a proxy to transform an identification protocol for Alice into an identification protocol for Bob using a re-proof key. PRE and PRS have been largely studied in the last decade, but surprisingly, no results about ZK-PRI have been published since the pioneer paper of Blaze et al.. We first show the insecurity of this scheme: just by observing the communications Alice can deduce Bob\u2019s secret key. Then we give (i) definitions of the different families of ZK-PRI (bidirectional/unidirectional and interactive/non-interactive) (ii) a formal security model for these primitives and (iii) a concrete construction for each family. Moreover, we show that ZK-PRI can be used to manage the acces policy to several services that require a public key authentication.",

            "abstract": "Search for different types of distinguishers are common tasks in symmetrickey cryptanalysis. In this work, we employ the constraint programming (CP) technique to tackle such problems. First, we show that a simple application of the CP approach proposed by Gerault et al. leads to the solution of the open problem of determining the exact lower bound of the number of active S-boxes for 6-round AES-128 in the related-key model. Subsequently, we show that the same approach can be applied in searching for integral distinguishers, impossible differentials, zero-correlation linear approximations, in both the single-key and related-(twea)key model. We implement the method using the open source constraint solver Choco and apply it to the block ciphers PRESENT, SKINNY, and HIGHT (ARX construction). As a result, we find 16 related-tweakey impossible differentials for 12-round SKINNY-64-128 based on which we construct an 18-round attack on SKINNY-64-128 (one target version for the crypto competition https://sites.google.com/site/skinnycipher announced at ASK 2016). Moreover, we show that in some cases, when equipped with proper strategies (ordering heuristic, restart and dynamic branching strategy), the CP approach can be very efficient. Therefore, we suggest that the constraint programming technique should become a convenient tool at hand of the symmetric-key cryptanalysts.",

The MapReduce users often outsource their data and computations to a public cloud provider. We focus on the fundamental problem of matrix multiplication, and address the inherent security and privacy concerns that occur when outsourcing to a public cloud. Our goal is to enhance the two state-of-the-art algorithms for MapReduce matrix multiplication with privacy guarantees such as: none of the nodes storing an input matrix can learn the other input matrix or the output matrix, and moreover, none of the nodes computing an intermediate result can learn the input or the output matrices. To achieve our goal, we rely on the well-known Paillier's cryptosystem and we use its partially homomorphic property to develop efficient algorithms that satisfy our problem statement. We develop two different approaches called Secure-Private (SP) and Collision-Resistant-Secure-Private (CRSP), and compare their trade-offs with respect to three fundamental criteria: computation cost, communication cost, and privacy guarantees. Finally, we give security proofs of our protocols.",

In this paper, we propose an alternative scheme, called LOCALPKI, where the binding is performed by the local authority and the issuance is left to the end user or to the local authority. The role of our third entity is then to register this binding and to provide up-to-date status information on this registration. The idea is that many more local actors could then take the role of a local authority, thus allowing for an easier spread of public-key certificates in the population. We also prove our scheme's security with Tamarin an automatic verification tool of cryptographic protocols.",

To achieve these properties, several accountable systems use at their core cryptographic primitives that produce non-repudiable evidence of inconsistent or incorrect behavior. In this paper, we show how selfish and colluding nodes can exploit the use of cryptographic digests in accountability protocols to mount what we call a duck attack. In a duck attack, selfish and colluding nodes exploit the use of cryptographic digests to alter the transmission of messages while masquerading as honest entities. The end result is that their selfish behavior remains undetected. This undermines the security guarantees of the accountability protocols. We first discover the duck attack while analyzing PAG --- a custom cryptographic protocol to build accountable systems presented at ICDCS 2016. We later discover that accountable distributed systems based on a secure log (essentially a hash-based data structure) are also vulnerable to the duck attack and apply it on AcTinG --- a protocol presented at SRDS 2014. To defeat our attack, we modify the underlying secure log to have high-order dependency on the messages stored in it.",

            "abstract": "Contactless communications have become omnipresent in our daily lives, from simple access cards to electronic passports. Such systems are particularly vulnerable to relay attacks, in which an adversary relays the messages from a prover to a verifier. Distance-bounding protocols were introduced to counter such attacks. Lately, there has been a very active research trend on improving the security of these protocols, but also on ensuring strong privacy properties with respect to active adversaries and malicious verifiers. In particular, a difficult threat to address is the terrorist fraud, in which a far-away prover cooperates with a nearby accomplice to fool a verifier. The usual defence against this attack is to make it impossible for the accomplice to succeed unless the prover provides him with enough information to recover his secret key and impersonate him later on. However, the mere existence of a long-term secret key is problematic with respect to privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach in which the prover does not leak his secret key but a reusable session key along with a group signature on it. This allows the adversary to impersonate him even without knowing his signature key. Based on this approach, we give the first distance-bounding protocol, called SPADE, integrating anonymity, revocability and provable resistance to standard threat models.",

            "abstract": "The Mobile WiMAX IEEE 802.16e is a new technology supporting broadband wireless communication with fixed and mobile access. The standard offers high throughput broadband connections, supporting handover and roaming capabilities, and provides a security sub layer, which is responsible for secrecy, authentication and secure key exchange. In the area of security aspects, Mobile WiMAX exhibits vulnerabilities while adopting improved security architecture. Several versions of 802.16 networks were released. While the first versions have shown some security weaknesses that were later corrected by the recently released versions, the security mechanisms of 802.16 still remain vulnerable and the limited deployment of such technology is insufficient to satisfy the demands of security. This paper focuses on reducing the security vulnerabilities in the authorization protocol PKM and the generation of traffic encryption keys (TEKs). We propose the usage of 1. A formal analysis of the PKM protocol (authorization phase and exchange of TEKs phase) and 2.Device certificate for key exchange process to provide secure authentication and 3. Give a formal analysis of our new PKM protocol (authorization phase and exchange of TEKs phase). The formal analysis has been conducted using a specialized model checker Scyther, which provides formal proofs of the security protocol. The revised authentication protocol is expected to provide better secure platform for all process of PKM.",

In Kakuro a grid has to be filled with numbers such that the sums per row and column match given values; similarly in KenKen a grid has to be filled with numbers such that in given areas the product, sum, difference or quotient equals a given value.

They are designed to operate for several months by featuring low activity cycles in order to save energy. In this paper, we propose a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for such WSNs with very low duty-cycles of 1% and less. Nodes are activated randomly and use a history of previous successful frame exchanges to decide their next activation time. We study the choice of the history size, and we compare the performance of our protocol with other protocols from the literature. We show by simulations and real experiments that with a limited history size of only six entries, our protocol achieves better performance than other protocols from the literature, while keeping the advantages of fully asynchronous protocols.",

            "abstract": "Ring and group signatures allow their members to anonymously sign documents in the name of the group. In ring signatures, members manage the group themselves in an ad-hoc manner while in group signatures, a manager is required. Moreover, k-times traceable group and ring signatures [1] allow anyone to publicly trace two signatures from a same user if he exceeds the a priori authorized number of signatures. In [2], Canard et al. give a 1-time traceable ring signature where each member can only generate one anonymous signature. Hence, it is possible to trace any two signatures from the same user. Some other works generalize it to the k-times case, but the traceability only concerns two signatures. In this paper, we define the notion of k-times full traceable ring signature (k-FTRS) such that all signatures produced by the same user are traceable if and only if he produces more than k signatures. We construct a k-FTRS called Ktrace. We extend existing formal security models of k-times linkable signatures to prove the security of Ktrace in the random oracle model. Our primitive k-FTRS can be used to construct a k-times veto scheme or a proxy e-voting scheme that prevents denial-of-service caused by cheating users.",

Intruders could try to penetrate the network, capture nodes or take control over particular nodes. In this context, it is important to revoke and renew keys that might be learned by malicious nodes. We propose several secure protocols for key revocation and key renewal based on symmetric encryption and elliptic curve cryptography. All protocols are secure, but have different security levels.

This paper fills this gap: in the formal framework of the applied n-calculus, we define several fundamental authentication and privacy properties and establish the first theoretical framework for the security analysis of e-exam protocols. As proof of concept we analyze two of such protocols with ProVerif. The first \u201csecure electronic exam system\u201d proposed in the literature turns out to have several severe problems.

They have found many applications in networking and distributed systems since their introduction by Benaloh and de Mare in 1993. Despite this popularity, there is currently no thorough performance evaluation of the different existing designs. Symmetric and asymmetric accumulators are used likewise without any particular argument to support either of the design. We aim to establish the speed of each design and their application's domains in terms of their size and the size of the values.",

They are used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of a message, and can also be used as a building block for larger schemes, such as chosen-ciphertext secure encryption, or identity-based encryption. We present a method for automatically proving the security for block-cipher-based and hash-based MACs in the ideal cipher model. Our method proceeds in two steps, following the traditional method for constructing MACs. First, the 'front end' of the MAC produces a short digest of the long message, then the 'back end' provides a mixing step to make the output of the MAC unpredictable for an attacker. We develop a Hoare logic for proving that the front end of the MAC is an almost-universal hash function. The programming language used to specify these functions is quite expressive. As a result, our logic can be used to prove functions based on block ciphers and hash functions. Second, we provide a list of options for the back end of the MAC, each consisting of only two or three instructions, each of which can be composed with an almost-universal hash function to obtain a secure MAC. Using our method, we implemented a tool that can prove the security of many CBC-based MACs (DMAC, ECBC, FCBC and XCBC to name only a few), PMAC and HMAC.",

            "abstract": "Many tools exist for automatic security protocol verification, and most of them have their own particular language for specifying protocols and properties. Several protocol specification models and security properties have been already formally related to each other. However, there is an important difference between verification tools, which has not been investigated in depth before: the explored state space. Some tools explore all possible behaviors, whereas others explore strict subsets, often by using so-called scenarios. Ignoring such differences can lead to wrong interpretations of the output of a tool. We relate the explored state spaces to each other and find previously unreported differences between the various approaches. We apply our study of state space relations in a performance comparison of several well-known automatic tools for security protocol verification. We model a set of protocols and their properties as homogeneously as possible for each tool. We analyze the performance of the tools over comparable state spaces. This work enables us to effectively compare these automatic tools, i.e. using the same protocol description and exploring the same state space. We also propose some explanations for our experimental results, leading to a better understanding of the tools.",

Many approaches have been developed in the literature to solve security problems of routing protocols for WSNs. But most of them are not resilient against attacks from compromised nodes because they only use cryptographic solutions. In our work, we design a new secure routing protocol to improve this resiliency using realistic assumptions such as asynchronous communication. We propose a probabilistic approach that allows us to save energy and to avoid malicious nodes with a detection system of safe paths using tabu lists, acknowledgments and trust counters. Our main result is that, even in presence of compromised nodes, our protocol ensures data confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and a high delivery rate.",

Most issues are related to security problems faced by cloud providers, who have to ensure that their infrastructure is properly secure and client data are protected, and by the customers, who must ensure proper security measures have been taken by the provider in order to protect their personal data. When you move your information into the cloud, you lose control of it. The cloud gives you access to your data, but you have no way of ensuring no one else has access to these data. In this article, we propose an evaluation of a proof-of-concept implementation of a usage control system for an ex post enforcement of privacy rules regarding the disclosure of personal data to third parties.

            "abstract": "Type-flaw attacks upon security protocols wherein agents are led to misinterpret message types have been reported frequently in the literature. Preventing them is crucial for protocol security and verification. Heather et al. proved that tagging every message field with it's type prevents all type-flaw attacks under a free message algebra and perfect encryption system. In this paper, we prove that type-flaw attacks can be prevented with the same technique even under the ACUN algebraic properties of XOR which is commonly used in \"real-world\" protocols such as SSL 3.0. Our proof method is general and can be easily extended to other monoidal operators that possess properties such as Inverse and Idempotence as well. We also discuss how tagging could be used to prevent type-flaw attacks under other properties such as associativity of pairing, commutative encryption, prefix property and homomorphic encryption.",

            "abstract": "The invention relates to a method, a computer program and a system for controlling the running of a mobile robot, in particular a humanoid robot moving on two legs. According to the prior art, this control is performed by controlling a characteristic point called Zero Motion Point. Said control is carried out in a fixed reference system linked to the progress surface of the robot and assumes the knowledge of the characteristics of said surface and the development of a predictive trajectory. This piloting mode encounters significant limitations due to the nature of the progression surfaces on which the march can be effectively controlled and the obligation to know perfectly their geometry; but also as to the necessary computing power, and to the appearance of the walk, which is little like a real human walk. The invention makes it possible to overcome these limitations by providing a step that includes a free or ballistic pseudo phase, a pulse phase given by the robot's heel and a landing phase.",

            "abstract": "Pervasive computing systems will likely be deployed in the near future, with the proliferation of wireless devices and the emergence of ad hoc networking as key enablers. Coping with mobility and the volatility of wireless communications in such systems is critical. Neighborhood discovery (ND) - the discovery of devices directly reachable for communication or in physical proximity - becomes a fundamental requirement and building block for various applications. However, the very nature of wireless mobile networks makes it easy to abuse ND and thereby compromise the overlying protocols and applications. Thus, providing methods to mitigate this vulnerability and secure ND is crucial. In this article we focus on this problem and provide definitions of neighborhood types and ND protocol properties, as well as a broad classification of attacks. Our ND literature survey reveals that securing ND is indeed a difficult and largely open problem. Moreover, given the severity of the problem, we advocate the need to formally model neighborhoods and analyze ND schemes.",

However, formal approaches usually consider the encryption schemes as black boxes and assume that an adversary cannot learn anything from an encrypted message except if he has the key. Such an assumption is too strong in general since some attacks exploit in a clever way the interaction between protocol rules and properties of cryptographic operators. Moreover, the executability of some protocols relies explicitly on some algebraic properties of cryptographic primitives such as commutative encryption. We give a list of some relevant algebraic properties of cryptographic operators, and for each of them, we provide examples of protocols or attacks using these properties.
