            "abstract": "Interactive Data Exploration (IDE) systems are technologies that facilitate the understanding of large datasets by providing high level easy-to-use operators. Compared to traditional querying systems, where users have to express each query, IDE systems allows users to perform expressive data exploration following the click-select-execute paradigm. Today, there exists no full-fledged evaluation framework for operator-enabled IDE. Most previous works are based on either logging user actions implicitly to compute quantitative metrics or running user studies to collect explicit feedback. Hence, there is a pressing need to articulate an evaluation framework that collects and compares quantitative human feedback along with system and data-centric evaluations. In this paper, we develop VALIDE, a preliminary design of a unified framework consisting of a methodology and metrics for IDE systems. VALIDE combines research from database benchmarking and human-computer interaction and will be demonstrated with a real IDE system.",

            "abstract": "We demonstrate DORA THE EXPLORER, a system that guides users in finding items of interest in a very large data set. DORA THE EXPLORER provides users with the full spectrum of exploration modes and is driven by Data Familiarity or Curiosity, as well as User Interventions. DORA THE EXPLORER is able to handle data and search scenario complexity, i.e., the difficulty to find scattered/clustered individual records in the data set, and user ability to express what s/he needs. DORA THE EXPLORER relies on Deep Reinforcement Learning that combines intrinsic (curiosity) and extrinsic (familiarity) rewards. DORA's main goal is to support scientific discovery from data. We describe the system architecture and illustrate it with three demonstration scenarios on a 2.6 mil-lion galaxies SDSS, a large sky survey data set1. A video of DORA THE EXPLORER is available at https://bit.ly/dora-demo, the codehttps://github.com/apersonnaz/rl-guided-galaxy-exploration, and the application at https://bit.ly/dora-application",

Such systems are a real opportunity for our community to cater to users with different domain and data science expertise. We introduce INODE - an end-to-end data exploration system - that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Research, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.",

            "abstract": "The ability to find a set of records in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) hinges on the scattering of objects in the data set and the on users\u2019 knowledge of data and their ability to express their needs. This yields a wide range of EDA scenarios and solutions that differ in the guidance they provide to users. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between modeling curiosity and familiarity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and expressive data exploration operators. We formalize curiosity as intrinsic reward and familiarity as extrinsic reward. We examine the behavior of several policies learned for different weights for those rewards. Our experiments on SDSS, a very large sky survey data set1 provide several insights and justify the need for a deeper examination of combining DRL and data exploration operators that go beyond drill-downs and roll-ups.",

In this paper, we present an algorithm that reconstructs life table raw data using a summary of results from published articles. We present the steps of the development and implementation (in the R computer language) of the algorithm, its scope of application, assumptions, and limitations. Statistical background of the algorithm is also presented. The developed algorithm was then applied to reconstruction of life table data of two insect species, Chilo partellus and Busseola fusca, from published information. Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test was applied to test the difference between the original and reconstructed data of the insect life stages. C. Partellus results were not significantly different, but, for B. fusca, pupa development time, and larva and pupa development rate were significantly different at the 95% confidence level. It is concluded that the algorithm could be used to reconstruct original data sets from cohort life table data sets of insects, given published information and sample sizes.",
