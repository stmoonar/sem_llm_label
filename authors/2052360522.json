To improve crowdsourced forecasting accuracy, we developed SAGE, a hybrid forecasting system that combines human and machine generated forecasts.

            "abstract": "In recent decades, the growing scale of scientific research has led to numerous novel findings. Reproducing these findings is the foundation of future research. However, due to the complexity of experiments, manually assessing scientific research is laborious and time-intensive, especially in social and behavioral sciences. Although increasing reproducibility studies have garnered increased attention in the research community, there is still a lack of systematic ways for evaluating scientific research at scale. In this paper, we propose a novel approach towards automatically assessing scientific publications by constructing a knowledge graph (KG) that captures a holistic view of the research contributions. Specifically, during the KG construction, we combine information from two different perspectives: micro-level features that capture knowledge from published articles such as sample sizes, effect sizes, and experimental models, and macro-level features that comprise relationships between entities such as authorship and reference information. We then learn low-dimensional representations using language models and knowledge graph embeddings for entities (nodes in KGs), which are further used for the assessments. A comprehensive set of experiments on two benchmark datasets shows the usefulness of leveraging KGs for scoring scientific research.",

            "abstract": "We examine probabilistic forecasts for battleground states in the 2020 US presidential election, using daily data from two sources over seven months: a model published by the Economist, and prices from the PredictIt exchange. We find systematic differences in accuracy over time, with markets performing better several months before the election, and the model performing better as the election approached. A simple average of the two forecasts performs better than either one of them overall, even though no average can outperform both component forecasts for any given state-date pair. This effect arises because the model and the market make different kinds of errors in different states: the model was confidently wrong in some cases, while the market was excessively uncertain in others. We conclude that there is value in using hybrid forecasting methods, and propose a market design that incorporates model forecasts via a trading bot to generate synthetic predictions. We also propose and conduct a profitability test that can be used as a novel criterion for the evaluation of forecasting performance.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting of geopolitical events is a notoriously difficult task, with experts failing to significantly outperform a random baseline across many types of forecasting events. One successful way to increase the performance of forecasting tasks is to turn to crowdsourcing: leveraging many forecasts from non-expert users. Simultaneously, advances in machine learning have led to models that can produce reasonable, although not perfect, forecasts for many tasks. Recent efforts have shown that forecasts can be further improved by ``hybridizing'' human forecasters: pairing them with the machine models in an effort to combine the unique advantages of both. In this demonstration, we present Synergistic Anticipation of Geopolitical Events (SAGE), a platform for human/computer interaction that facilitates human reasoning with machine models.",

            "abstract": "People often rely on forecasts from multiple experts to make decisions about uncertain events in diverse domains such as health and finance. Research has differentiated between perceptions of conflicting forecasts and those of imprecise forecasts, finding more conflict aversion for gains and more imprecision aversion for losses (Baillon, Cabantous, & Wakker, 2012; Smithson, 1999, 2013). However, conflict and imprecision are rarely well differentiated and are often correlated. We examine the joint and distinct effects of conflict and imprecision by modeling subjective estimates focusing on the effect of key attributes of forecast sets: (a) the structure of overlap and (b) level of asymmetry. Participants (N = 358 recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk) saw a series of triplets of interval forecasts of financial market volatility (e.g., forecast A: 0\u201320% improvement; forecast B: 5\u201395% improvement; and forecast C: 10\u2013100% improvement) varied in structure of overlap (intersecting, disjoint, or mixed) and level of asymmetry. Participants estimated the most likely value and range of possible values for each forecast set. We used various measures of central tendency and agreement to model the estimates using the pairwise technique developed by Broomell, Budescu, and Por (2014). The ratio of unique predictions that deviate from the estimates less for one model compared to another indicates which model is more accurate. The geometric mean of accuracy ratios between a given model and all others, weighted by the number of distinct predictions, summarizes the relative accuracy of a model. Models were first compared across all sets and then by the major factors. Results",
