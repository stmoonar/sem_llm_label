            "abstract": "The Future of Work (FoW) is witnessing an evolution where AI systems (broadly machines or businesses) are used to the benefit of humans. Work here refers to all forms of paid and unpaid labor in both physical and virtual workplaces and that is enabled by AI systems. This covers crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, online labor marketplaces such as TaskRabbit and Qapa, but also regular jobs in physical workplaces. Bringing humans back to the frontier of FoW will increase their trust in AI systems and shift their perception to use them as a source of self-improvement, ensure better work performance, and positively shape social and economic outcomes of a society and a nation. To enable that, physical and virtual workplaces will need to capture human traits, behavior, evolving needs, and provide jobs to all. Attitudes, values, opinions regarding the processes and policies will need to be assessed and considered in the design of FoW ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Online job marketplaces are becoming very popular. Either jobs or people are ranked by algorithms. For example, Google and Facebook job search return a ranked list of jobs given a search query. TaskRabbit and Fiverr, on the other hand, produce rank-ings of workers for a given query. Qapa, an online marketplace, can be used to rank both workers and jobs. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for fairness to study ranking workers and jobs. We case study two particular sites: Google job search and TaskRabbit. Our framework addresses group fairness where groups are obtained with any combination of protected attributes. We define a measure for unfairness for a given group, query and location. We also define two generic fairness problems that we address in our framework: quantification, such as finding the k groups (resp., queries, locations) for which the site is most or least unfair, and comparison, such as finding the locations at which fairness between two groups differs from all locations, or finding the queries for which fairness at two locations differ from all queries. Since the number of groups, queries and locations can be arbitrarily large, we adapt Fagin top-k algorithms to address our fairness problems. To evaluate our framework, we run extensive experiments on two datasets crawled from TaskRabbit and Google job search.",

            "abstract": "The rise of self-employment empowered by platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and Uber has drastically changed our perception of work. The possibility to link requesters and workers from all over the world in a scalable manner has resulted in advancements in the work world that would not have been possible otherwise. However, many ethical concerns related to fairness, transparency, and bias regarding these new forms of work have also been raised. In this paper, we present our vision on these ethical issues, how they can be combated in the future of work, and how this will impact the data management research community and future work platforms.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT The use of serious games to improve collaborative skill transfer and retention has received considerable attention from scholars, web marketing practitioners and business consultants. Team rankings and learning progress in game learning analytics, however, have yet to be empirically examined. Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to study the performance of competing teams in a web marketing serious game (Simbound), we highlight a combination of causal conditions (engagement, reach and profitability) affecting team rankings. This paper proposes a conceptual architecture of the forces that influence learning progress within a collaborative learning environment. This learning environment is studied for web marketing boot camps powered by Simbound at three European universities: Grenoble Alpes University (France), University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy) and Dunarea de Jos University of Galati (Romania). Gaining knowledge of cases through game learning analytics is valuable for two reasons: It emphasises the instructor\u2019s role in mobilising players\u2019 engagement, and it tests variability across cases, offering precursors of team performance rankings. This approach to collective skill retention highlights the moderating factors of team performance rankings, whilst purposely calibrating a gameable learning environment. This paper enriches our knowledge of how active experimentation in learning analytics metrics can develop skills for real business competition.",
