            "title": "Doc-GCN: Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Networks for Document Layout Analysis",
            "abstract": "Recognizing the layout of unstructured digital documents is crucial when parsing the documents into the structured, machine-readable format for downstream applications. Recent studies in Document Layout Analysis usually rely on visual cues to understand documents while ignoring other information, such as contextual information or the relationships between document layout components, which are vital to boost better layout analysis performance. Our Doc-GCN presents an effective way to harmonize and integrate heterogeneous aspects for Document Layout Analysis. We construct different graphs to capture the four main features aspects of document layout components, including syntactic, semantic, density, and appearance features. Then, we apply graph convolutional networks to enhance each aspect of features and apply the node-level pooling for integration. Finally, we concatenate features of all aspects and feed them into the 2-layer MLPs for document layout component classification. Our Doc-GCN achieves state-of-the-art results on three widely used DLA datasets: PubLayNet, FUNSD, and DocBank. The code will be released at https://github.com/adlnlp/doc_gcn",

In this paper, we propose a Graph-based KB and Text Fusion Interaction Network (GTFIN) to improve the performance of the incomplete QA system by utilizing the KB and text information.In GTFIN, to reduce the influence of the query-unrelated noisy information of GAT on final answer prediction, we first design a global-normalization graph attention network (GGAT) by determining the query-related edge weights from the global perspective, and then a coarse-to-fine text reader (CFReader) is proposed to both exploit the relation information and obtain the entity mention representation in the text to enhance the incomplete KB. We further incorporate a bi-attention mechanism to enhance the interaction between question and entity representation which could find more query-related entities for final answer prediction. On the widely used KBQA benchmark WebQSP, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

            "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of identifying irrelevant items from a small set of similar documents using Web search engine suggests. Specifically, we collected volumes of Web pages through Web search engines and inspected the page contents using topic models. Among each cluster of pages sharing the same topic indicated by the topic model, our technique discovers potential content organization in the current page cluster and identifies pages that are out of focus from that topic. The metrics in our approach mainly consist of search engine suggest frequency and inter-document similarity measures. The intuition is that Web pages collected via the same search queries are more likely to share similar contents. We verify this intuition by implementing a subtopic based document selection framework and making quantitative evaluation against human made labeled data sets. Our evaluation result reveals that suggest frequency analysis along with inter-document similarity measure is effective at filtering off-topic documents in small data sets with satisfactory performance.",

            "abstract": "Collaborative filtering is regarded as one of the most promising approaches in recommender systems. To date, it is best known for its use on e-commerce web sites. It has also been widely used in other areas, for example, filtering Usenet News, recommending TV shows and web personalization. However, a survey of existing algorithms shows there remain some fundamental research questions in overcoming some challenges for collaborative filtering system. These questions influence the prevalence of the recommendation systems to a great extent. \u2022 Scalability: A large online retailer might have huge amounts of data, tens of millions of customers and millions of distinct catalogue items. These \u201clong user rows\u201d slow down the performance of the recommender system, further reducing scalability. \u2022 Accuracy: Accuracy of collaborative filtering considers the problem of how the system would successfully measure the similarity between users (in user-based approaches) or items (in item-based approaches) in order to discover the intrinsic properties that exist amongst users and/or amongst item. Users need recommendations of high quality and they can trust to help them. \u2022 Robustness: Robustness of collaborative filtering systems is defined as the ability to provide accurate predictions given some degree of noise in the data. \u2022 Sparsity: It refers to the fact that most users do not rate many items and hence the user-item rating matrix is very sparse and insufficient to identify similarities in consumer interests. In many commercial recommender systems, even active users may have purchased less than 1% of the items, (1% of 2 million books is 20,000 books). As a result, the accuracy of recommendations may be poor. \u2022 Cold Start: It has been used to describe the situation when almost nothing is known about the new users or new items. This dissertation focuses on effectiveness and efficiency of collaborative filtering technologies. We proposed a novel collaborative filtering framework which is capable of dealing with an immense and dynamic dataset effectively and efficiently. Specifically, we improved the existing algorithms from the following aspects: 1. Generic Model: Integrate the content-based filtering and collaborative filtering by unifying the external attributes of users and items with rating information in a generic model. 2. Effectiveness: 1)Propose a new method of computing similarity in collaborative filtering to better reflect the reality. 2)Consider the interest drift in collaborative filtering. We introduce the time recency to tackle it. 3. Efficiency: Propose a number of solutions towards traditional item-based and user-based collaborative filtering which can handle a large scale of data in the dynamical environment. The experiments have shown that our proposed framework can substantially improve the performance of traditional collaborative filtering algorithms. The main contributions of this dissertation include: demonstrating a generic model, improving the accuracy of collaborative filtering through the new similarity computation and addressing interest drift in the traditional collaborative filtering and providing a highly efficient incremental framework which can be easily used for the online applications and an effective indexing which can reduce the time complexity of the traditional algorithms dramatically.",

This paper introduces a novel approach to providing recommendations using collaborative filtering when user rating is arrived over an incoming data stream. In this case a large number of data records can arrive rapidly making it impossible to save all of them for later analysis. Moreover, user interests may change over time. By dynamically building a decision tree for every item as data arrive, the incoming data stream is used effectively with a trade off between catching up the changes of users interests and accuracy. By adding a simple step using a hierarchy of items taxonomy, it is also possible to further improve the predicted ratings made by each decision tree and generate recommendations in realtime. Empirical studies with the dynamically built decision trees show that our algorithm works effectively and improves the overall prediction accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Collaborative filtering is regarded as one of the most promising recommendation algorithms. Traditional approaches for collaborative filtering do not take concept drift into account. For example, user purchase interests may be volatile. A new mother may be interested in baby toys, although previously she had no interest in these. A man may like romantic films while he preferred action movies one year ago. Collaborative filtering is characterized by concept drift in the real world. To make time-critical predictions, we argue that the target users' recent ratings reflect his/her future preferences more than older ratings. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm namely recency-based collaborative filtering to explore the weights for items based on their expected accuracy on the future preferences. Our proposed approach is based on item-based collaborative filtering algorithms. Specifically, we design a new similarity function to produce similarity scores that better reflect the reality. Our experimental results have shown that the new algorithm substantially improves the precision of traditional collaborative filtering algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Collaborative filtering is regarded as one of the most promising recommendation algorithms. The item-based approaches for collaborative filtering identify the similarity between two items by comparing users' ratings on them. In these approaches, ratings produced at different times are weighted equally. That is to say, changes in user purchase interest are not taken into consideration. For example, an item that was rated recently by a user should have a bigger impact on the prediction of future user behaviour than an item that was rated a long time ago. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to compute the time weights for different items in a manner that will assign a decreasing weight to old data. More specifically, the users' purchase habits vary. Even the same user has quite different attitudes towards different items. Our proposed algorithm uses clustering to discriminate between different kinds of items. To each item cluster, we trace each user's purchase interest change and introduce a personalized decay factor according to the user own purchase behaviour. Empirical studies have shown that our new algorithm substantially improves the precision of item-based collaborative filtering without introducing higher order computational complexity.",
