            "title": "Saliency-Aware Interpolative Augmentation for Multimodal Financial Prediction",
            "abstract": "Predicting price variations of financial instruments for risk modeling and stock trading is challenging due to the stochastic nature of the stock market. While recent advancements in the Financial AI realm have expanded the scope of data and methods they use, such as textual and audio cues from financial earnings calls, limitations exist. Most datasets are small, and show domain distribution shifts due to the nature of their source, suggesting the exploration for data augmentation for robust augmentation strategies such as Mixup. To tackle such challenges in the financial domain, we propose SH-Mix: Saliency-guided Hierarchical Mixup augmentation technique for multimodal financial prediction tasks. SH-Mix combines multi-level embedding mixup strategies based on the contribution of each modality and context subsequences. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on financial earnings and conference call datasets consisting of text and speech, we show that SH-Mix outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3-7%. Additionally, we show that SH-Mix is generalizable across different modalities and models.",

            "abstract": "Mixup is an efficient data augmentation technique, which improves generalization by interpolating random examples. While numerous approaches have been developed for Mixup in the Euclidean and in the hyperbolic space, they do not fully use the intrinsic properties of the examples, i.e., they manually set the geometry (Euclidean or hyperbolic) based on the overall dataset, which may be sub-optimal since each example may require a different geometry. We propose DynaMix, a framework that automatically selects an example-specific geometry and performs Mixup between the different geometries to improve training dynamics and generalization. Through extensive experiments in image and text modalities we show that DynaMix outperforms state-of-the-art methods over six downstream applications. We find that DynaMix is more useful in low-resource and semi-supervised settings likely because it displays a probabilistic view of the geometry.",

Existing works that augment KG completion require either (1) factual triples to enlarge the graph reasoning space or (2) manually designed prompts to extract knowledge from a pre-trained language model (PLM), exhibiting limited performance and requiring expensive efforts from experts. To this end, we propose TAGREAL that automatically generates quality query prompts and retrieves support information from large text corpora to probe knowledge from PLM for KG completion. The results show that TAGREAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. We find that TAGREAL has superb performance even with limited training data, outperforming existing embedding-based, graph-based, and PLM-based methods.",

            "abstract": "Social media enable users to share their feelings and emotional struggles. They also offer an opportunity to provide community support to suicidal users. Recent studies on suicide risk assessment have explored the user's historic timeline and information from their social network to analyze their emotional state. However, such methods often require a large amount of user-centric data. A less intrusive alternative is to only use conversation trees arising from online community responses. Modeling such online conversations between the community and a person in distress is an important context for understanding that person's mental state. However, it is not trivial to model the vast number of conversation trees on social media, since each comment has a diverse influence on a user in distress. Typically, a handful of comments/posts receive a significantly high number of replies, which results in scale-free dynamics in the conversation tree. Moreover, psychological studies suggested that it is important to capture the fine-grained temporal irregularities in the release of vast volumes of comments, since suicidal users react quickly to online community support. Building on these limitations and psychological studies, we propose HCN, a Hyperbolic Conversation Network, which is a less user-intrusive method for suicide ideation detection. HCN leverages the hyperbolic space to represent the scale-free dynamics of online conversations. Through extensive quantitative, qualitative, and ablative experiments on real-world Twitter data, we find that HCN outperforms state-of-the art methods, while using 98% less user-specific data, and while maintaining a 74% lower carbon footprint and a 94% smaller model size. We also find that the comments within the first half an hour are most important to identify at-risk users.",

            "title": "Cryptocurrency Bubble Detection: A New Stock Market Dataset, Financial Task & Hyperbolic Models",
            "abstract": "The rapid spread of information over social media influences quantitative trading and investments. The growing popularity of speculative trading of highly volatile assets such as cryptocurrencies and meme stocks presents a fresh challenge in the financial realm. Investigating such \u201cbubbles\u201d - periods of sudden anomalous behavior of markets are critical in better understanding investor behavior and market dynamics. However, high volatility coupled with massive volumes of chaotic social media texts, especially for underexplored assets like cryptocoins pose a challenge to existing methods. Taking the first step towards NLP for cryptocoins, we present and publicly release CryptoBubbles, a novel multi- span identification task for bubble detection, and a dataset of more than 400 cryptocoins from 9 exchanges over five years spanning over two million tweets. Further, we develop a set of sequence-to-sequence hyperbolic models suited to this multi-span identification task based on the power-law dynamics of cryptocurrencies and user behavior on social media. We further test the effectiveness of our models under zero-shot settings on a test set of Reddit posts pertaining to 29 \u201cmeme stocks\u201d, which see an increase in trade volume due to social media hype. Through quantitative, qualitative, and zero-shot analyses on Reddit and Twitter spanning cryptocoins and meme-stocks, we show the practical applicability of CryptoBubbles and hyperbolic models.",
