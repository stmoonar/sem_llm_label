            "abstract": "Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is the transportation version of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) in road scenarios. One key technology of VEC is task offloading, which allows vehicles to send their computation tasks to the surrounding Roadside Units (RSUs) or other vehicles for execution, thereby reducing computation delay and energy consumption. However, the existing task offloading schemes still have various gaps and face challenges that should be addressed because vehicles with time-varying trajectories need to process massive data with high complexity and diversity. In this paper, a VEC-based computation offloading model is developed with consideration of data dependency of tasks. The minimization of the average response time and average energy consumption of the system is defined as a combinatorial optimization problem. To solve this problem, we propose a Mobility-aware dependent task offloading (MESON) Scheme for urban VEC and develop a DRL-based algorithm to train the offloading strategy. To improve the training efficiency, a vehicle mobility detection algorithm is further designed to detect the communication time between vehicles and RSUs. In this way, MESON can avoid unreasonable decisions by lowering the size of the action space. Moreover, to improve the system stability and the offloading successful rate, we design a task priority determination scheme to prioritize the tasks in the waiting queue. The experimental results show that MESON is superior compared to other task offloading schemes in terms of the average response time, average system energy consumption, and offloading successful rate.",

In VEC, task offloading enables vehicles to offload computing tasks to nearby Roadside Units (RSUs), thereby reducing the computation cost.

            "abstract": "In vehicular networks, some edge servers may not function properly due to the time-varying load condition and the uneven computing resource distribution, resulting in a low quality of caching services. To overcome this challenge, we develop a Vehicular dew computing (VDC) architecture for the first time by combining dew computing with vehicular networks, which can achieve wireless communication between vehicles in a resource-constrained environment. Consequently, it is crucial to develop an adaptive caching scheme that empowers vehicles to form efficient cooperation in VDC. In this paper, we propose an intelligent caching scheme based on VDC architecture, which includes two parts. First, to meet the dynamic nature of VDC, a spatiotemporal vehicle clustering algorithm is proposed to establish adaptive cooperation to assist content caching for vehicles. Second, the multi-armed bandit algorithm is employed to select suitable content for caching in vehicles based on real-time file popularity, and a model is established to dynamically update each vehicle\u2019s request preferences. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed scheme has excellent performance in terms of cluster head stability and cache hit rate.",

            "abstract": "Edge caching has emerged as a promising approach to meet explosive mobile data on 6G networks. One critical issue in edge caching is file popularity prediction. The federated learning (FL) based distributed algorithm is used to predict file popularity, which solves user privacy issues in centralized algorithms. However, due to the heterogeneity of user devices, the feedback time (i.e., the update and upload time of model parameters) is various for each user, which causes the feedback delay in the framework of FL-based edge caching. In this letter, we devise a feedback delay-tolerant proactive caching scheme (FLASH) based on FL in which each user utilizes hybrid filtering on stacked autoencoders to train the prediction model locally. Experimental results indicate that FLASH can effectively handle feedback delay and outperform counterpart algorithms in cache efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm that exposes Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) to road scenarios. In VEC, task offloading can enable vehicles to offload the computing tasks to nearby Roadside Units (RSUs) that deploy computing capabilities. However, the highly dynamic network topology, strict low-delay constraints, and massive data of tasks of VEC pose significant challenges for implementing efficient offloading. Digital Twin-based VEC is emerging as a promising solution that enables real-time monitoring of the state of the VEC network through mapping and interaction between the physical and virtual worlds, thus assisting in making sound offload decisions in the physical world. Thus, this paper proposes an intelligent partial offloading scheme, namely, Digital Twin-Assisted Intelligent Partial Offloading (IGNITE). First, to find the optimal offloading space in advance, we combine the improved clustering algorithm with the Digital Twin (DT) technique, in which unreasonable decisions can be avoided by reducing the size of the decision space. Second, to reduce the overall cost of the system, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is employed to train the offloading strategy, allowing for automatic optimization of computational delay and vehicle service price. To improve the efficiency of cooperation between digital and physical spaces, a feedback mechanism is established. It can adjust the parameters of the clustering algorithm based on the final offloading results in this clustering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on DT-assisted vehicle offloading that proposes a feedback mechanism, forming a complete closed loop as prediction-offloading-feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IGNITE has significant advantages in terms of total system computational cost, total computational delay, and offloading success rate compared with its counterparts.",

With the powerful prediction capability of GAN, the data of DT is advanced with the physical entity, which is an effective assistant for task offloading. Then, we leverage the distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to make offloading decisions, which consider the limited resources of RSUs and the cooperation of vehicles. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve excellent performance in terms of system stability and efficiency.",
