            "title": "A Comprehensive Survey and Experimental Study of Subgraph Matching: Trends, Unbiasedness, and Interaction",
            "abstract": "Subgraph matching is a fundamental problem in graph analysis. In recent years, many subgraph matching algorithms have been proposed, making it pressing and challenging to compare their performance and identify their strengths and weaknesses. We observe that (1) The embedding enumeration in the classic filtering-ordering-enumerating framework dominates the overall performance, and thus enhancing the backtracking paradigm is becoming a current research trend; (2) Simply changing the limitation of output size results in a substantial variation in the ranking of different methods, leading to biased performance evaluation; (3) The techniques employed at different stages of subgraph matching interact with each other, making it less feasible to replace and evaluate a single technique in isolation. Therefore, a comprehensive survey and experimental study of subgraph matching is necessary to identify the current trends, ensure unbiasedness, and investigate the potential interactions. In this paper, we comprehensively review the methods in the current trend and experimentally confirm their advantage over prior approaches. We unbiasedly evaluate the performance of these algorithms by using an effective metric, namely embeddings per second. To fully investigate the interactions between various techniques, we select 10 representative techniques for each stage and evaluate all the feasible combinations.",

            "title": "Dynamic Graph Embedding via Meta-Learning",
            "abstract": "Graphs in real-world applications usually evolve constantly presenting dynamic behaviors such as social networks and transportation networks. Hence, dynamic graph embedding has gained much attention recently. In dynamic graphs, both the topology and node attributes could change over time, which pose great challenges for developing effective embedding models. Typically, the evolution process of a dynamic graph can be recorded as a series of snapshots. We observe that the evolution process inherently provides both prior information (previous snapshots) and validation information (the next snapshot). The prior information can be used to fit the evolution process, while the validation information can be used to improve the generalization ability of a graph embedding model. However, existing dynamic graph embedding models only utilize the prior information, but overlook the validation information. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel dynamic graph embedding method via Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, which utilizes both kinds of information to obtain better graph representation. The extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods on various graph analysis tasks.",

            "title": "Efficiently Cleaning Structured Event Logs: A Graph Repair Approach",
            "abstract": "Event data are often dirty owing to various recording conventions or simply system errors. These errors may cause serious damage to real applications, such as inaccurate provenance answers, poor profiling results, or concealing interesting patterns from event data. Cleaning dirty event data is strongly demanded. While existing event data cleaning techniques view event logs as sequences, structural information does exist among events, such as the task passing relationships between staffs in workflow or the invocation relationships among different micro-services in monitoring application performance. We argue that such structural information enhances not only the accuracy of repairing inconsistent events but also the computation efficiency. It is notable that both the structure and the names (labeling) of events could be inconsistent. In real applications, while an unsound structure is not repaired automatically (which requires manual effort from business actors to handle the structure error), it is highly desirable to repair the inconsistent event names introduced by recording mistakes. In this article, we first prove that the inconsistent label repairing problem is NP-complete. Then, we propose a graph repair approach for (1) detecting unsound structures, and (2) repairing inconsistent event names. Efficient pruning techniques together with two heuristic solutions are also presented. Extensive experiments over real and synthetic datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.",

            "abstract": "Clustering on uncertain data, one of the essential tasks in mining uncertain data, posts significant challenges on both modeling similarity between uncertain objects and developing efficient computational methods. The previous methods extend traditional partitioning clustering methods like $(k)$-means and density-based clustering methods like DBSCAN to uncertain data, thus rely on geometric distances between objects. Such methods cannot handle uncertain objects that are geometrically indistinguishable, such as products with the same mean but very different variances in customer ratings. Surprisingly, probability distributions, which are essential characteristics of uncertain objects, have not been considered in measuring similarity between uncertain objects. In this paper, we systematically model uncertain objects in both continuous and discrete domains, where an uncertain object is modeled as a continuous and discrete random variable, respectively. We use the well-known Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure similarity between uncertain objects in both the continuous and discrete cases, and integrate it into partitioning and density-based clustering methods to cluster uncertain objects. Nevertheless, a nai\u0308ve implementation is very costly. Particularly, computing exact KL divergence in the continuous case is very costly or even infeasible. To tackle the problem, we estimate KL divergence in the continuous case by kernel density estimation and employ the fast Gauss transform technique to further speed up the computation. Our extensive experiment results verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our approaches.",
