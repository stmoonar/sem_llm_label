            "abstract": "Fast screening of drug molecules based on the ligand binding affinity is an important step in the drug discovery pipeline. Graph neural fingerprint is a promising method for developing molecular docking surrogates with high throughput and great fidelity. In this study, we built a COVID-19 drug docking dataset of about 300,000 drug candidates on 23 coronavirus protein targets. With this dataset, we trained graph neural fin-gerprint docking models for high-throughput virtual COVID-19 drug screening. The graph neural fingerprint models yield high prediction accuracy on docking scores with the mean squared error lower than 0.21 kcal/mol for most of the docking targets, showing significant improvement over conventional circular fin-gerprint methods. To make the neural fingerprints transferable for unknown targets, we also propose a transferable graph neural fingerprint method trained on multiple targets. With comparable accuracy to target-specific graph neural fingerprint models, the training and data efficiency of the transferable model is several times higher. We highlight that the impact of this study extends beyond COVID-19 dataset, as our approach for fast virtual ligand screening can be easily adapted and integrated into a general machine learning-accelerated pipeline to battle future bio-threats.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

We discuss innovations in computational infrastructure and methods that are accelerating and advancing drug design. Specifically, we describe several methods that integrate artificial intelligence and simulation-based approaches, and the design of computational infrastructure to support these methods at scale. We discuss their implementation, characterize their performance, and highlight science advances that these capabilities have enabled.",

            "abstract": "Researchers across the globe are seeking to rapidly repurpose existing drugs or discover new drugs to counter the the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). One promising approach is to train machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools to screen large numbers of small molecules. As a contribution to that effort, we are aggregating numerous small molecules from a variety of sources, using high-performance computing (HPC) to computer diverse properties of those molecules, using the computed properties to train ML/AI models, and then using the resulting models for screening. In this first data release, we make available 23 datasets collected from community sources representing over 4.2 B molecules enriched with pre-computed: 1) molecular fingerprints to aid similarity searches, 2) 2D images of molecules to enable exploration and application of image-based deep learning methods, and 3) 2D and 3D molecular descriptors to speed development of machine learning models. This data release encompasses structural information on the 4.2 B molecules and 60 TB of pre-computed data. Future releases will expand the data to include more detailed molecular simulations, computed models, and other products.",

            "abstract": "Due to the sheer volume of data it is typically impractical to analyze the detailed performance of an HPC application running at-scale. While conventional small-scale benchmarking and scaling studies are often sufficient for simple applications, many modern workflow-based applications couple multiple elements with competing resource demands and complex inter-communication patterns for which performance cannot easily be studied in isolation and at small scale. This work discusses Chimbuko, a performance analysis framework that provides real-time, in situ anomaly detection. By focusing specifically on performance anomalies and their origin (aka provenance), data volumes are dramatically reduced without losing necessary details. To the best of our knowledge, Chimbuko is the first online, distributed, and scalable workflow-level performance trace analysis framework. We demonstrate the tool\u2019s usefulness on Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s Summit system.",

With recent trends in HPC leading toward increasing reliance on heterogeneous accelerator-based architectures such as graphics processing units (GPU), existing code bases must embrace these architectural advances to maintain the high levels of performance that have come to be expected for these methods. In this work, we purpose a three-level parallelism scheme for the distributed numerical integration of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential in the Gaussian basis set discretization of the Kohn\u2013Sham equations on large computing clusters consisting of multiple GPUs per compute node. In addition, we purpose and demonstrate the efficacy of the use of batched kernels, including batched level-3 BLAS operations, in achieving high levels of performance on the GPU. We demonstrate the performance and scalability of the implementation of the purposed method in the NWChemEx software package by comparing to the existing scalable CPU XC integration in NWChem.",

            "abstract": "The Theory-Software Translation Workshop, held in New Orleans in February 2019, explored in depth the process of both instantiating theory in software - for example, implementing a mathematical model in code as part of a simulation - and using the outputs of software - such as the behavior of a simulation - to advance knowledge. As computation within research is now ubiquitous, the workshop provided a timely opportunity to reflect on the particular challenges of research software engineering - the process of developing and maintaining software for scientific discovery. In addition to the general challenges common to all software development projects, research software additionally must represent, manipulate, and provide data for complex theoretical constructs. Ensuring this process is robust is essential to maintaining the integrity of the science resulting from it, and the workshop highlighted a number of areas where the current approach to research software engineering would benefit from an evidence base that could be used to inform best practice. \nThe workshop brought together expert research software engineers and academics to discuss the challenges of Theory-Software Translation over a two-day period. This report provides an overview of the workshop activities, and a synthesises of the discussion that was recorded. The body of the report presents a thematic analysis of the challenges of Theory-Software Translation as identified by workshop participants, summarises these into a set of research areas, and provides recommendations for the future direction of this work.",

            "abstract": "In exascale scientific computing, it is essential to efficiently monitor, evaluate and improve performance. Visualization and especially visual analytics are useful and inevitable techniques in the exascale computing era to enable such a human-centered experience. In this ongoing work, we present a visual analytics framework for performance evaluation of scientific workflows. Ultimately, we aim to solve two current challenges: the capability to deal with workflows, and the scalability toward exascale scenario. On the way to achieve these goals, in this work, we first incorporate TAU (Tuning and Analysis Utilities) instrumentation tool and improve it to accommodate workflow measurements. Then we establish a web-based visualization framework, whose back end handles data storage, query and aggregation, while front end presents the visualization and takes user interaction. In order to support the scalability, a few level-of-detail mechanisms are developed. Finally, a chemistry workflow use case is adopted to verify our methods.",

            "abstract": "Faults are commonplace in large scale systems. These systems experience a variety of faults such as transient, permanent and intermittent. Multi-bit faults are typically not corrected by the hardware resulting in an error. This paper attempts to answer an important question: Given a multi-bit fault in main memory, will it result in an application error - and hence a recovery algorithm should be invoked - or can it be safely ignored? We propose an application fault modeling methodology to answer this question. Given a fault signature (a set of attributes comprising of system and application state), we use machine learning to create a model which predicts whether a multi-bit permanent/transient main memory fault will likely result in error. We present the design elements such as the fault injection methodology for covering important data structures, the application and system attributes which should be used for learning the model, the supervised learning algorithms (and potentially ensembles), and important metrics. We use three applications - NWChem, LULESH and SVM - as examples for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed fault modeling methodology.",
