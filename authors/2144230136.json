            "abstract": "Most cross-domain recommenders require samples on target domains or source-target overlaps to carry out domain adaptation. However, in many real-world situations, target domains are lack of such knowledge. Few works discuss this problem, whose essence is domain generalization recommendation. In this paper, we figure out domain generalization recommendation with a clear symbolized definition and propose corresponding models. Moreover, we illustrate its strong connection with zero-shot recommendation, pretrained recommendation and cold-start recommendation, distinguishing it from content-based recommendation. By analyzing its properties, we propose HIRL^+ and a series of heuristic methods to solve this problem. We propose hierarchical invariant learning to expel the specific patterns in both domain-level and environment-level, and find the common patterns in generalization space. To make the division of environments flexible, fine-grained and balanced, we put forward a learnable environment assignment method. To improve the robustness against distribution shifts inside domain generalization, we present an adversarial environment refinement method. In addition, we conduct experiments on real-word datasets to verify the effectiveness of our models, and carry out further studies on the domain distance and domain diversity. To benefit the research community and promote this direction, we discuss the future of this field.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the reproducibility of recommendation models has become a severe concern in recommender systems. In light of this challenge, we have previously released a unified, comprehensive and efficient recommendation library called RecBole, attracting much attention from the research community. With the increasing number of users, we have received a number of suggestions and update requests. This motivates us to make further improvements on our library, so as to meet the user requirements and contribute to the research community. In this paper, we present a significant update of RecBole, making it more user-friendly and easy-to-use as a comprehensive benchmark library for recommendation. More specifically, the highlights of this update are summarized as: (1) we include more benchmark models and datasets, improve the benchmark framework in terms of data processing, training and evaluation, and release reproducible configurations to benchmark the recommendation models; (2) we upgrade the user friendliness of our library by providing more detailed documentation and well-organized frequently asked questions, and (3) we propose several development guidelines for the open-source library developers. These extensions make it much easier to reproduce the benchmark results and stay up-to-date with the recent advances on recommender systems.

            "abstract": "Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating causal inference into recommender systems to answer the hypothetical question: \"what would be the potential feedback when a user is recommended a product?\" Various unbiased estimators, including Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) and Doubly Robust (DR), have been proposed to address this question. However, these estimators often assume that confounders are precisely observable, which is not always the case in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called Adversarial Training-based IPS (AT-IPS), which uses adversarial training to handle noisy confounders. The proposed method defines a feasible region for the confounders, obtains the worst-case noise (adversarial noise) within the region, and jointly trains the propensity model and the prediction model against such noise to improve their robustness. We provide a theoretical analysis of the accuracy-robustness tradeoff of AT-IPS and demonstrate its superior performance compared to other popular estimators on both real-world and semi-synthetic datasets.",

            "abstract": "Recommender system has deeply revolutionized people\u2019s daily life and production, bringing a large amount of business value. In the recommendation domain, simulation and real data-based studies are two typical research paradigms, with each having different advantages. Previously, real data-based studies occupy more important positions, since accurately simulating the user preference is quite difficult. Recently, large language models (LLM) have shown great potential to achieve human-like intelligence, which provides new opportunities to overcome the short-comings of simulation-based studies and thus highlight their advantages, such as much more application scenarios and cheaper data acquisition strategies. To shed lights on this direction, in this paper, we introduce an LLM-based recommender simulator called RecAgent. Our simulator is composed of two modules: (1) the user module and (2) the recommender module. The user module can browse the recommendation website, communicate with other users and broadcast messages on the social media. The recommender module is designed to provide search or recommendation lists to the users, and one can design different models to implement the recommender. All the users take actions based on LLMs, and can freely evolve like in the real world. We present several case studies to demonstrate that the users in our simulator can indeed behave in a reasonable manner as expected.

            "abstract": "Explainable recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from both academic and industry communities. Among different explainable strategies, generating natural language explanations is an important method, which can deliver more informative, flexible and readable explanations to facilitate better user decisions. Despite the effectiveness, existing models are mostly optimized based on the observed datasets, which can be skewed due to the selection or exposure bias. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we formulate the task of explainable recommendation with a causal graph, and design a causality enhanced framework to generate unbiased explanations. More specifically, we firstly define an ideal unbiased learning objective, and then derive a tractable loss for the observational data based on the inverse propensity score (IPS), where the key is a sample re-weighting strategy for equalizing the loss and ideal objective in expectation. Considering that the IPS estimated from the sparse and noisy recommendation datasets can be inaccurate, we introduce a fault tolerant mechanism by minimizing the maximum loss induced by the sample weights near the IPS. For more comprehensive modeling, we further analyze and infer the potential latent confounders induced by the complex and diverse user personalities. We conduct extensive experiments by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods based on three real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

Recently, substantial evidences have suggested that by learning huge amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) can achieve human-like intelligence. We believe these models can provide significant opportunities to more believable user behavior simulation. To inspire such direction, we propose an LLM-based agent framework and design a sandbox environment to simulate real user behaviors. Based on extensive experiments, we find that the simulated behaviors of our method are very close to the ones of real humans.

            "abstract": "Explaining recommendation with natural languages has shown to be an effective strategy to improve the recommendation pervasiveness and user satisfaction. While recent years have witnessed many promising models, they mostly consider the user-item interactions as independent samples. However, in real-world scenarios, the user preference is always dynamic and evolving, and the current user behaviors may have strong correlations with the previous ones. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose to build an explainable recommender model by considering the user dynamic preference. Our general idea is to build a sequential model to capture the user history behaviors, and then the explanations are generated by summarizing all the past interactions. In specific, we firstly deploy two independent components to model the user sequential interactions and reviews separately. Then, we design a duration-aware attention mechanism to discriminate the importance of different items and reviews. For more effectively modeling the history information, we introduce a denoising module to remove the user behaviors which are less important for the current prediction. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model based on three real-world datasets, in which the best performance can be improved by about 13.3%, 6.5%, 5.0% and 1.9% on the metrics of BLEU-1, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and MAE, respectively. In addition, we also evaluate the generated explanations from both qualitative and qualitative perspectives.",

            "abstract": "Explainable recommendation has attracted much attention from the industry and academic communities. It has shown great potential for improving the recommendation persuasiveness, informativeness and user satisfaction. Despite a lot of promising explainable recommender models have been proposed in the past few years, the evaluation strategies of these models suffer from several limitations. For example, the explanation ground truths are not labeled by real users, the explanations are mostly evaluated based on only one aspect and the evaluation strategies can be hard to unify. To alleviate the above problems, we propose to build an explainable recommendation dataset with multi-aspect real user labeled ground truths. In specific, we firstly develop a video recommendation platform, where a series of questions around the recommendation explainability are carefully designed. Then, we recruit about 3000 users with different backgrounds to use the system, and collect their behaviors and feedback to our questions. In this paper, we detail the construction process of our dataset and also provide extensive analysis on its characteristics. In addition, we develop a library, where ten well-known explainable recommender models are implemented in a unified framework. Based on this library, we build several benchmarks for different explainable recommendation tasks. At last, we present many new opportunities brought by our dataset, which are expected to shed some new lights to the explainable recommendation field. Our dataset, library and the related documents have been released at https://reasoner2023.github.io/.",

            "abstract": "With the ever prospering of the web technologies, there is a common need to make recommendations from heterogeneous sources, such as recommending products and advertisements together on the e-commerce websites. People usually solve such recommendation problem by a two-stage paradigm, where the first stage is generating candidates from each source, and the second one is aggregating and ranking the generated heterogeneous candidates to produce the final results. While existing models have achieved many successes, they mostly optimize the above two stages separately, where the user preferences can only be used to supervise the second stage, while for the first one, there is no signal to tell whether the generated candidates are accurate enough to cover the user preference. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we design a multi-agent framework to jointly optimize the above two stages. In specific, suppose there are N sources in our problem, then we deploy N+1 agents, where the first N agents correspond one-to-one with the sources, aiming to select the sources-specific candidates, and the last agent is designed to aggregate the candidates from different sources for the final recommendation. All the agents play a cooperative game, aiming to maximize the rewards revealing user preferences. We implement our idea based on the Deep Q-network, where we design a decomposable reward to enhance the training efficiency. We adapt our model to a real-world recommendation problem abstracted from a famous short video platform-Kuaishou.com. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",

            "abstract": "Modeling user sequential behaviors have been demonstrated to be effective in promoting the recommendation performance. While previous work has achieved remarkable successes, they mostly assume that the training and testing distributions are consistent, which may contradict with the diverse and complex user preferences, and limit the recommendation performance in real-world scenarios. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a robust sequential recommender framework to overcome the potential distribution shift between the training and testing sets. In specific, we firstly simulate different training distributions via sample reweighting. Then, we minimize the largest loss induced by these distributions to optimize the 'worst-case' loss for improving the model robustness. Considering that there can be too many sample weights, which may introduce too much flexibility and be hard to optimize, we cluster the training samples based on both hard and soft strategies, and assign each cluster with a unified weight. At last, we analyze our framework by presenting the generalization error bound of the above minimax objective, which help us to better understand the proposed framework from the theoretical perspective. We conduct extensive experiments based on three real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. To reproduce our experiments and promote this research direction, we have released our project at https://anonymousrsr.github.io/RSR/.",
