            "abstract": "We present KnowEnG, a free-to-use computational system for analysis of genomics data sets, designed to accelerate biomedical discovery. It includes tools for popular bioinformatics tasks such as gene prioritization, sample clustering, gene set analysis and expression signature analysis. The system offers \u2018knowledge-guided\u2019 data-mining and machine learning algorithms, where user-provided data are analyzed in light of prior information about genes, aggregated from numerous knowledge-bases and encoded in a massive \u2018Knowledge Network\u2019. KnowEnG adheres to \u2018FAIR\u2019 principles: its tools are easily portable to diverse computing environments, run on the cloud for scalable and cost-effective execution of compute-intensive and data-intensive algorithms, and are interoperable with other computing platforms. They are made available through multiple access modes including a web-portal, and include specialized visualization modules. We present use cases and re-analysis of published cancer data sets using KnowEnG tools and demonstrate its potential value in democratization of advanced tools for the modern genomics era.",

            "abstract": "The H3ABioNet pan-African bioinformatics network, which is funded to support the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) program, has developed node-assessment exercises to gauge the ability of its participating research and service groups to analyze typical genome-wide datasets being generated by H3Africa research groups. We describe a framework for the assessment of computational genomics analysis skills, which includes standard operating procedures, training and test datasets, and a process for administering the exercise. We present the experiences of 3 research groups that have taken the exercise and the impact on their ability to manage complex projects. Finally, we discuss the reasons why many H3ABioNet nodes have declined so far to participate and potential strategies to encourage them to do so.",

            "abstract": "Recent growth in the volume of DNA sequence data and associated computational costs of extracting meaningful information warrants the need for efficient computational systems at-scale. In this work, we propose the Illinois Genomics Execution Environment (IGen), a framework for efficient and scalable genome analyses. The design philosophy of IGen is based on algorithmic analysis and extensive measurements on compute- and data-intensive genomic analyses workflows (such as variant discovery and genotyping analysis) executed on high-performance and cloud computing infrastructures. IGen leverages the advantages of existing designs and proposes new software improvements to overcome the ine ciencies we observe in our measurements. Based on these composite improvements, we demonstrate that IGen is able to accelerate the alignment from 13.1 hours to 10.8 hours (1.2x) and the variant from 10.1 hours to 1.25 hours (8x) calling on a single node, and its modular design scales e ciently in a parallel computing environment.",

The Center is organized around the construction of \"Knowledge Engine for Genomics\" (KnowEnG), an E-science framework for genomics where biomedical scientists will have access to powerful methods of data mining, network mining, and machine learning to extract knowledge out of genomics data. The scientist will come to KnowEnG with their own data sets in the form of spreadsheets and ask KnowEnG to analyze those data sets in the light of a massive knowledge base of community data sets called the \"Knowledge Network\" that will be at the heart of the system. The Center is undertaking discovery projects aimed at testing the utility of KnowEnG for transforming big data to knowledge. These projects span a broad range of biological enquiry, from pharmacogenomics (in collaboration with Mayo Clinic) to transcriptomics of human behavior.",

            "abstract": "Theoretical considerations predict that amplification of expressed gene transcripts by reverse transcription-PCR using arbitrarily chosen primers will result in the preferential amplification of the central portion of the transcript. Systematic, high-throughput sequencing of such products would result in an expressed sequence tag (EST) database consisting of central, generally coding regions of expressed genes. Such a database would add significant value to existing public EST databases, which consist mostly of sequences derived from the extremities of cDNAs, and facilitate the construction of contigs of transcript sequences. We tested our predictions, creating a database of 10,000 sequences from human breast tumors. The data confirmed the central distribution of the sequences, the significant normalization of the sequence population, the frequent extension of contigs composed of existing human ESTs, and the identification of a series of potentially important homologues of known genes. This approach should make a significant contribution to the early identification of important human genes, the deciphering of the draft human genome sequence currently being compiled, and the shotgun sequencing of the human transcriptome.",
