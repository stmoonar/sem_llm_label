            "title": "BIP! NDR (NoDoiRefs): A Dataset of Citations From Papers Without DOIs in Computer Science Conferences and Workshops",
            "abstract": "In the field of Computer Science, conference and workshop papers serve as important contributions, carrying substantial weight in research assessment processes, compared to other disciplines. However, a considerable number of these papers are not assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), hence their citations are not reported in widely used citation datasets like OpenCitations and Crossref, raising limitations to citation analysis. While the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) previously addressed this issue by providing substantial coverage, its discontinuation has created a void in available data. BIP! NDR aims to alleviate this issue and enhance the research assessment processes within the field of Computer Science. To accomplish this, it leverages a workflow that identifies and retrieves Open Science papers lacking DOIs from the DBLP Corpus, and by performing text analysis, it extracts citation information directly from their full text. The current version of the dataset contains more than 510K citations made by approximately 60K open access Computer Science conference or workshop papers that, according to DBLP, do not have a DOI.",

            "abstract": "The International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge: Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023) is now running its third edition. The Sci-K workshop is a venue that brings together researchers and practitioners from different disciplines (including, but not limited to, Digital Libraries, Information Extraction, Machine Learning, Semantic Web, Knowledge Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Scholarly Communication, Science of Science, Scientometrics and Bibliometrics), as well as professionals from the industry, to explore innovative solutions and ideas for the production and consumption of Scientific Knowledge Graphs and assessing the research impact. The workshop has called for high-quality submissions around the three main themes of research, related to scientific knowledge: representation, discovery, and assessment. In response to the call for papers, the workshop has received outstanding submissions from researchers in 15 different countries: United States of America, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Canada, India, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Denmark, Ethiopia, and Norway. Each paper was reviewed at least by three members of the programme committee. Given the quality and the interesting topics covered by the submissions, we accepted 10 papers. Sci-K 2023 builds on two previous successful editions and keeps attracting a combined pool of attendees. The first edition (Sci-K 2021), was held on 13 April 2021 in conjunction with The Web Conference 2021. Its program consisted of two keynote talks, and the presentation of 11 research papers. The second edition (Sci-K 2022) took place on the 26 April 2022 at The Web Conference 2022. The program included the presentation of 5 long papers, 4 short papers, 2 vision papers, 2 keynote speeches and a panel on \u201cWhat\u2019s next after Microsoft Academic Graph?\u201d. The full program as well as the list of accepted papers can be found on the Sci-K website: https://sci-k.github.io/2023/.",

The communities behind these graphs strive to gather, clean, and integrate scholarly metadata from various sources to produce clean and easy-to-process knowledge graphs. In this context, a very important task of the respective cleaning and integration workflows is deduplication. In this paper, we briefly describe and evaluate the accuracy of the deduplication algorithm used for the OpenAIRE Research Graph. Our experiments show that the algorithm has an adequate performance producing a small number of false positives and an even smaller number of false negatives.",

In response, a number of initiatives that attempt to provide guidelines towards fairer research assessment frameworks have been established. In this work, we present BIP!

Exploring and mining HINs relies on metapath queries that identify pairs of entities connected by relationships of diverse semantics. While the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads on large, web-scale HINs is highly demanding in computational cost, current approaches do not exploit interrelationships among the queries. In this paper, we present Atrapos, a new approach for the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads that leverages a combination of efficient sparse matrix multiplication and intermediate result caching. Atrapos selects intermediate results to cache and reuse by detecting frequent sub-metapaths among workload queries in real time, using a tailor-made data structure, the Overlap Tree, and an associated caching policy. Our experimental study on real data shows that Atrapos accelerates exploratory data analysis and mining on HINs, outperforming off-the-shelf caching approaches and state-of-the-art research prototypes in all examined scenarios.",

As this trend keeps growing, practitioners in the field of scholarly knowledge are confronted with several challenges. In this special issue, we focus on two major categories of such challenges: (a) those related to the organization of scholarly data to achieve a flexible, context-sensitive, finegrained, and machine-actionable representation of scholarly knowledge that at the same time is structured, interlinked, and semantically rich, and (b) those related to the design of novel, reliable, and comprehensive metrics to assess scientific impact.",

            "abstract": "The automatic extraction of topics is a standard technique for summarizing text corpora from various domains (e.g., news articles, transport or logistic reports, scientific publications) that has several applications. Since, in many cases, topics are subject to continuous change there is the need to monitor the evolution of a set of topics of interest, as the corresponding corpora are updated. The evolution of scientific topics, in particular, is of great interest for researchers, policy makers, fund managers, and other professionals/engineers in the research and academic community. In this work, we demonstrate a prototype that provides intuitive visualisations for the evolution of scientific topics providing insights about topic transformation, merging, and splitting during the recent years. Although the prototype works on top of a scientific text corpus, its implementation is generic and can be easily applied on texts from other domains, as well.",
