            "title": "Pain Forecasting using Self-supervised Learning and Patient Phenotyping: An attempt to prevent Opioid Addiction",
            "abstract": "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a chronic genetic disorder characterized by recurrent acute painful episodes. Opioids are often used to manage these painful episodes; the extent of their use in managing pain in this disorder is an issue of debate. The risk of addiction and side effects of these opioid treatments can often lead to more pain episodes in the future. Hence, it is crucial to forecast future patient pain trajectories to help patients manage their SCD to improve their quality of life without compromising their treatment. It is challenging to obtain many pain records to design forecasting models since it is mainly recorded by patients' self-report. Therefore, it is expensive and painful (due to the need for patient compliance) to solve pain forecasting problems in a purely supervised manner. In light of this challenge, we propose to solve the pain forecasting problem using self-supervised learning methods. Also, clustering such time-series data is crucial for patient phenotyping, anticipating patients' prognoses by identifying\"similar\"patients, and designing treatment guidelines tailored to homogeneous patient subgroups. Hence, we propose a self-supervised learning approach for clustering time-series data, where each cluster comprises patients who share similar future pain profiles. Experiments on five years of real-world datasets show that our models achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art benchmarks and identify meaningful clusters that can be translated into actionable information for clinical decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Cross-modal recipe retrieval has gained prominence due to its ability to retrieve a text representation given an image representation and vice versa. Clustering these recipe representations based on similarity is essential to retrieve relevant information about unknown food images. Existing studies cluster similar recipe representations in the latent space based on class names. Due to inter-class similarity and intraclass variation, associating a recipe with a class name does not provide sufficient knowledge about recipes to determine similarity. However, recipe title, ingredients, and cooking actions provide detailed knowledge about recipes and are a better determinant of similar recipes. In this study, we utilized this additional knowledge of recipes, such as ingredients and recipe title, to identify similar recipes, emphasizing attention especially on rare ingredients. To incorporate this knowledge, we propose a knowledge-infused multimodal cooking representation learning network, Ki-Cook, built on the procedural attribute of the cooking process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to adopt a comprehensive recipe similarity determinant to identify and cluster similar recipe representations. The proposed network also incorporates ingredient images to learn multimodal cooking representation. Since the motivation for clustering similar recipes is to retrieve relevant information for an unknown food image, we evaluated the ingredient retrieval task. We performed an empirical analysis to establish that our proposed model improves the Coverage of Ground Truth by 12% and the Intersection Over Union by 10% compared to the baseline models. On average, the representations learned by our model contain an additional 15.33% of rare ingredients compared to the baseline models. Owing to this difference, our qualitative evaluation shows a 39% improvement in clustering similar recipes in the latent space compared to the baseline models, with an inter-annotator agreement of the Fleiss kappa score of 0.35.",

            "abstract": "Irregularly sampled time series data are common in a variety of fields. Many typical methods for drawing insight from data fail in this case. Here we attempt to generalize methods for clustering trajectories to irregularly and sparsely sampled data. We first construct synthetic data sets, then propose and assess four methods of data alignment to allow for application of spectral clustering. We also repeat the same process for real data drawn from medical records of patients with sickle cell disease -- patients whose subjective experiences of pain were tracked for several months via a mobile app. We find that different methods for aligning irregularly sampled sparse data sets can lead to different optimal numbers of clusters, even for synthetic data with known properties. For the case of sickle cell disease, we find that three clusters is a reasonable choice, and these appear to correspond to (1) a low pain group with occasionally acute pain, (2) a group which experiences moderate mean pain that fluctuates often from low to high, and (3) a group that experiences persistent high levels of pain. Our results may help physicians and patients better understand and manage patients' pain levels over time, and we expect that the methods we develop will apply to a wide range of other data sources in medicine and beyond.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the use of natural language processing (NLP) models to evaluate whether language patterns used by item writers in a medical licensure exam might contain evidence of biased or stereotypical language. This type of bias in item language choices can be particularly impactful for items in a medical licensure assessment, as it could pose a threat to content validity and defensibility of test score validity evidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt using machine learning (ML) and NLP to explore language bias on a large item bank. Using a prediction algorithm trained on clusters of similar item stems, we demonstrate that our approach can be used to review large item banks for potential biased language or stereotypical patient characteristics in clinical science vignettes. The findings may guide the development of methods to address stereotypical language patterns found in test items and enable an efficient updating of those items, if needed, to reflect contemporary norms, thereby improving the evidence to support the validity of the test scores.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in natural language processing have enabled automation of a wide range of tasks, including machine translation, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. Automated summarization of documents, or groups of documents, however, has remained elusive, with many efforts limited to extraction of keywords, key phrases, or key sentences. Accurate abstractive summarization has yet to be achieved due to the inherent difficulty of the problem, and limited availability of training data. In this paper, we propose a topic-centric unsupervised multi-document summarization framework to generate extractive and abstractive summaries for groups of scientific articles across 20 Fields of Study (FoS) in Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and news articles from DUC-2004 Task 2. The proposed algorithm generates an abstractive summary by developing salient language unit selection and text generation techniques. Our approach matches the state-of-the-art when evaluated on automated extractive evaluation metrics and performs better for abstractive summarization on five human evaluation metrics (entailment, coherence, conciseness, readability, and grammar). We achieve a kappa score of 0.68 between two co-author linguists who evaluated our results. We plan to publicly share MAG- 20, a human-validated gold standard dataset of topic-clustered research articles and their summaries to promote research in abstractive summarization.",

In recent years, clinical research advances in brain aging have focused on the earliest clinically detectable stage of incipient dementia, commonly known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Currently, these disorders are diagnosed using a manual analysis of neuropsychological examinations. We measure the feasibility of using the linguistic characteristics of verbal utterances elicited during neuropsychological exams of elderly subjects to distinguish between elderly control groups, people with MCI, people diagnosed with possible Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and probable AD. We investigated the performance of both theory-driven psycholinguistic features and data-driven contextual language embeddings in identifying different clinically diagnosed groups. Our experiments show that a combination of contextual and psycholinguistic features extracted by a Support Vector Machine improved distinguishing the verbal utterances of elderly controls, people with MCI, possible AD, and probable AD. This is the first work to identify four clinical diagnosis groups of dementia in a highly imbalanced dataset. Our work shows that machine learning algorithms built on contextual and psycholinguistic features can learn the linguistic biomarkers from verbal utterances and assist clinical diagnosis of different stages and types of dementia, even with limited data.",

            "abstract": "Linked Open Data (LOD) is the publicly available RDF data in the Web. Each LOD entity is identfied by a URI and accessible via HTTP. LOD encodes globalscale knowledge potentially available to any human as well as artificial intelligence that may want to benefit from it as background knowledge for supporting their tasks. LOD has emerged as the backbone of applications in diverse fields such as Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, and many more. Nevertheless, regardless of the specific tasks that LOD-based tools aim to address, the reuse of such knowledge may be challenging for diverse reasons, e.g. semantic heterogeneity, provenance, and data quality. As aptly stated by Heath et al. Linked Data might be outdated, imprecise, or simply wrong\": there arouses a necessity to investigate the problem of linked data validity. This work reports a collaborative effort performed by nine teams of students, guided by an equal number of senior researchers, attending the International Semantic Web Research School (ISWS 2018) towards addressing such investigation from different perspectives coupled with different approaches to tackle the issue.",

However, for dynamic real-world applications such as social networks, recommender systems, computational biology, relational knowledge representation has emerged as a challenging research problem where there is a need to represent the changing nodes, attributes, and edges over time. The evolution of search engine responses to user queries in the last few years is partly because of the role of KGs such as Google KG. KGs are significantly contributing to various AI applications from link prediction, entity relations prediction, node classification to recommendation and question answering systems. This article is an attempt to summarize the journey of KG for AI.",
