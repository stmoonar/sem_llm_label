            "abstract": "To address rapid fluctuations in non-stationary channel environments, adaptive pilot patterns are commonly used. However, frequent pilot pattern changes require an interactive mechanism for terminal communication. In this letter, we introduce a time-domain pilot muting mechanism (TDPMM) based on the densest pilot pattern, combined with power optimization using deep reinforcement learning. This approach aims to mitigate issues associated with frequent pilot pattern adjustments in non-stationary channel fading environments. We first formulate an energy efficiency (EE) optimization model that balances normalized mean square error (NMSE) and energy consumption (EC) for large-scale continuous resource blocks (RBs) using TDPMM. Then, we propose a deep Q-network (DQN) based learning strategy tailored to optimize TDPMM selection and the power ratio between pilot and data signals. Simulation experiments confirm the superior EE performance of the proposed TDPMM. Furthermore, our DQN-based approach demonstrates lower complexity and only slightly inferior performance compared to the exhaustive search strategy.",

            "abstract": "Pre-distortion is a key technique to compensate for the nonlinear distortions caused by the transmitter in wireless communication systems. Generally, pre-distortion can be classified into digital pre-distortion (DPD) and analog pre-distortion (APD), which focus on optimizing and assessing the nonlinearity in their own areas. In this paper, we propose a new DPD approach to optimize the performance metric of the analog RF-domain (i.e., inter-modulation distortion (IMD) or adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR)) and that of the digital IF-domain (i.e., mean square error (MSE)) simultaneously. To make the joint design feasible, we derive a new hybrid performance metric, where the analog preferred metric is defined in the form of digital signals to bridge the gap between digital and analog signal processing. On top of that, an effective DPD scheme is developed based on a new dual time-delayed neural network (TDNN) learning architecture. The coefficients of the TDNN for power amplifier (PA) modeling can be trained offline with a PA dataset, while those of the TDNN for pre-distortion are obtained adaptively by optimizing the proposed joint design metric. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is able to significantly improve the IMD/ACPR performance without compromising the MSE, compared to conventional DPD schemes.",

            "abstract": "Image matting is an important computer vision problem. Many existing matting methods leverage a hand-made trimap to provide auxiliary information, which is expensive and time-consuming for real-world applications. In recent years, some trimap-free methods have been proposed, which completely get rid of any user input. However, their performance lag far behind trimap-based methods due to the ambiguity problem. This paper proposes a matting method that uses flexible interactive guidance as user hints, which means the proposed method can use trimap, scribblemap, clickmap, and bounding box as guidance information or can even work without any guidance input. Our goal is to maintain accuracy while simplifying input. To achieve this, we propose Progressive Trimap Deformation (PTD) scheme that gradually transforms the input trimaps into scribblemaps during training. To enable bounding box input, based on the same network, this paper proposes Progressive Bounding Box Deformation (PBD) scheme that gradually turns trimaps into bounding box masks during training. To further ensure the stability of training and enhance performance, this paper also introduces the Random Deformation Degree scheme. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve competitive results compared with existing trimap-based and trimap-free methods.",

            "abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC) offers an opportunity for devices relying on wireless power transfer (WPT), to accomplish computationally demanding tasks. Such WPT-powered MEC systems have yet to be optimized for long-term efficiency, due to random and changing task demands and wireless channel states of the devices. This paper presents an augmented two-staged deep Q-network (DQN), referred to as \u201cTS-DQN,\u201d for online optimization of WPT-powered MEC systems, where the WPT, offloading schedule, channel allocation, and the CPU configurations of the edge server and devices are jointly optimized to minimize the long-term average energy requirement of the systems. The key idea is to design a DQN for learning the channel allocation and task admission, while the WPT, offloading time and CPU configurations are efficiently optimized to precisely evaluate the reward of the DQN and substantially reduce its action space. Another important aspect is that a new action generation method is developed to expand and diversify the actions of the DQN, further accelerating its convergence. As validated by simulations, the proposed TS-DQN is much more energy efficient and converges much faster, than its potential alternative directly using the state-of-the-art Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm to learn all decision variables.",

However, mobile edge computing (MEC) makes it possible to solve this problem. This paper considers the scene of completing video-based AI inference tasks in the MEC system. We formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) to reduce inference delays, energy consumption and to improve recognition accuracy. We give a simplified expression of the inference complexity model and accuracy model through derivation and experimentation. The problem is then solved iteratively by using alternating optimization. Specifically, by assuming that the offloading decision is given, the problem is decoupled into two sub-problems, i.e., the resource allocation problem for the devices set that completes the inference tasks locally, and that for the devices set that offloads tasks. For the problem of offloading decision optimization, we propose a Channel-Aware heuristic algorithm. To further reduce the complexity, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based distributed algorithm. The ADMM-based algorithm has a low computational complexity that grows linearly with the number of devices. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of proposed algorithms. The trade-off relationship between delay, energy consumption, and accuracy is also analyzed.",

            "abstract": "With the increasing on-board demand for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs), the fifth-generation (5G) wireless systems are being massively utilized in vehicular networks. As an essential component, content retrieval in the ICV provides a basis for vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure data interaction for many applications. However, content access is still subject to performance degradation due to congested communication channels, diverse requests patterns, and intermittent network connectivity. To mitigate these issues, in-network caching in 5G-enabled ICV has been leveraged to benefit content access by allowing edge nodes to store content for data generators. In this paper, we propose an in-network caching scheme to support various provisions of data sharing in the ICVs by exploring the advantages of information-centric networks (ICN). We first divide each on-board service into several content units. Then, we place these units at the ICV and small cell base stations (SBSs) to reduce the content retrieval delay, further model the proposed system as an integer nonlinear program (INLP) and attain the optimal QoE (Quality of Experience) by placing content units at appropriate cache entities. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and correctness of our proposed model through extensive simulations.",

Leveraging the stochastic dual-subgradient method, a distributed online resource allocation and energy trading (ORE) algorithm is proposed to make real-time decisions of beamforming, service schedule and energy management. The feasibility and asymptotic optimality of the proposed ORE are established by theoretical analysis based on the Lyapunov optimization.",

            "title": "ERDBF: Embedding-Regularized Double Branches Fusion for Multi-Modal Age Estimation",
            "abstract": "Human age information is present in the face image and speech, but most age estimation methods focus on single-modal data only. Although multi-modal approaches have achieved promising performance in other fields by leveraging complementarity between modalities, the development of age estimation has hardly been more inspired by them because of the problem of modality missing in age data. In this paper, we propose an Embedding-Regularized Double Branches Fusion (ERDBF) framework that can simultaneously handle single-modal and multi-modal age estimation. To address the modality missing, we design a double branches fusion network which consists of an embedding regularization module and an information interaction module. The former aims to enhance the representational capacity of single-modal features. The latter learns inter-modal complementary information. Through their collaboration in the fusion process, the network can extract discriminative age representations, and even if a certain modality is missing, robust age estimation can be achieved using enhanced single-modal information. To our best knowledge, the proposed framework is the first deep learning-based multi-modal age estimation framework that can easily utilize the achievements made in the single-modal and have broader applications. Experimental results show that our best method achieves state-of-the-art results on AgeVoxCeleb. The code is available at https://github.com/Daretowin/ERDBF.",
