            "abstract": "Customers reach out to online live chat agents with various intents, such as asking about product details or requesting a return. In this paper, we propose the problem of predicting user intent from browsing history and address it through a two-stage approach. The first stage classifies a user's browsing history into high-level intent categories. Here, we represent each browsing history as a text sequence of page attributes and use the ground-truth class labels to fine-tune pretrained Transformers. The second stage provides a large language model (LLM) with the browsing history and predicted intent class to generate fine-grained intents. For automatic evaluation, we use a separate LLM to judge the similarity between generated and ground-truth intents, which closely aligns with human judgments. Our two-stage approach yields significant performance gains compared to generating intents without the classification stage.",

            "abstract": "Developing a universal model that can efficiently and effectively respond to a wide range of information access requests-from retrieval to recommendation to question answering---has been a long-lasting goal in the information retrieval community. This paper argues that the flexibility, efficiency, and effectiveness brought by the recent development in dense retrieval and approximate nearest neighbor search have smoothed the path towards achieving this goal. We develop a generic and extensible dense retrieval framework, called framework, that can handle a wide range of (personalized) information access requests, such as keyword search, query by example, and complementary item recommendation. Our proposed approach extends the capabilities of dense retrieval models for ad-hoc retrieval tasks by incorporating user-specific preferences through the development of a personalized attentive network. This allows for a more tailored and accurate personalized information access experience. Our experiments on real-world e-commerce data suggest the feasibility of developing universal information access models by demonstrating significant improvements even compared to competitive baselines specifically developed for each of these individual information access tasks. This work opens up a number of fundamental research directions for future exploration.",

            "abstract": "This research studies the problem of email overload and proposes a system that automatically detects whether the email is \"to read\" or \"to do\". The goal of our research is to test if we could automate both the features extraction and sentence classification phases by using word embedding. We propose to achieve this goal using a simple feature-based adaptation approach, where email's sentences are represented as dense numeric vectors of reduced dimensionality using either word embeddings or sentence encodings. Given that several types of word embeddings and sentence encodings exist, we compare email's sentence representations corresponding to different word embeddings and sentence encodings with the goal of understanding what embeddings/encodings are more suitable for use in the task of detecting the intent of an email. Our experimental results using three different types of embeddings: context-free word embeddings (word2vec and GloVe), contextual word embeddings (ELMo and BERT), and sentence embeddings (DAN-based Universal Sentence Encoder and Transformer-based Universal Sentence Encoder) suggest that the email's sentences representations based on ELMo embeddings produce better results than the representations that use other embeddings. We achieved an accuracy of 90.10%, comparing with word2vec (82.02%), BERT (58.08%), DAN-based USE (86.66%), and Transformer-based USE (88.16%).",

The goal of our research is to test if a Language Model trained on the entire Enron email data (around 500,000 emails) then retrained on a subset of intent labeled emails (i.e. transfer learning) would outperform an LSTM model trained on the intent email dataset only. We conduct several experiments using transfer learning in three different scenarios: 1) using pre-trained Language Model as features extractor for SVC. 2) retrain all layers of the pre-trained Language Model on the intent email dataset. 3) gradually retraining the pre-trained Language Model layer by layer, starting from the last layer. We evaluate the results on a subset of Enron Email Dataset. Comparing with a baseline model consists of two LSTM layers, we were able to increase the accuracy from 85.42% to 88.43%.",

            "abstract": "Email is one of the most useful communication tools over the Internet; Email can be an effective knowledge management tool which conveniently enables fast and accurate communication. On the other side, the increasing volume of email threatens to cause a st ate of \"email overload\" at which the volume of messages exceeds individuals' capacity to process them. This paper presents a personal email agent, named PAEA (Personal Assistant Email Agent), which assists the user to send all his/her email messages to the ir recipients and automatically download the user email message from the email server. The agent is designed to be able to classify the incoming email messages into folders, and to prioritize them so that the user can focus on more important emails first. The agent prioritizes messages according to user profile and his historical reaction. PAEA can instantaneously update his learning from the user behavior to be more effective and adaptive in doing the email sorting task.",
