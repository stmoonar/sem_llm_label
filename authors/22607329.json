            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied on a variety of real-world applications, such as social recommendation. However, existing GNN-based models on social recommendation suffer from serious problems of generalization and oversmoothness, because of the underexplored negative sampling method and the direct implanting of the off-the-shelf GNN models. In this paper, we propose a succinct multi-network GNN-based neural model (NeMo) for social recommendation. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed model explores a generative negative sampling strategy, and leverages both the positive and negative user-item interactions for users' interest propagation. The experiments show that NeMo outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on various real-world benchmark datasets (e.g., by up to 38.8% in terms of NDCG@15).",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, catalog relationship problems in e-commerce stores have been handled as pairwise classification tasks, which limit the ability of machine learning models to learn from the diverse relationships among different entities in the catalog. In this paper, we leverage heterogeneous graphs and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for improving catalog relationship inference. We start from investigating how to create multi-entity, multi-relationship graphs from diverse relationship data sources, and then explore how to utilizing GNNs to leverage the knowledge of the constructed graph in a self-supervised fashion. We finally propose a distillation approach to transfer the knowledge learned by GNNs into a pairwise neural network for seamless deployment in the catalog pipeline that relies on pairwise input for inductive relationship inference. Our experiments exhibit that in two of the representative catalog relationship problems, Title Authority/Contributor Authority and Broken Variation, the proposed framework is able to improve the recall at 95% precision of a pairwise baseline by up to 33.6% and 14.0%, respectively. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of this approach in advancing catalog quality maintenance and accurate relationship modeling, with potential for broader industry adoption.",

            "abstract": "Finding node correspondence across networks, namely multi-network alignment, is an essential prerequisite for joint learning on multiple networks. Despite great success in aligning networks in pairs, the literature on multi-network alignment is sparse due to the exponentially growing solution space and lack of high-order discrepancy measures. To fill this gap, we propose a hierarchical multi-marginal optimal transport framework named HOT for multi-network alignment. To handle the large solution space, multiple networks are decomposed into smaller aligned clusters via the fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) barycenter. To depict high-order relationships across multiple networks, the FGW distance is generalized to the multi-marginal setting, based on which networks can be aligned jointly. A fast proximal point method is further developed with guaranteed convergence to a local optimum. Extensive experiments and analysis show that our proposed HOT achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in both effectiveness and scalability.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are ubiquitous data structure which have been used in many applications. Knowledge graph reasoning aims to discover or infer knowledge based on existing information in the knowledge graph. However, most of the existing works belong to point-wise approaches, which perform reasoning w.r.t. a single piece of clue. Comparative reasoning over knowledge graph focuses on inferring common-ality and inconsistency with respect to multiple pieces of clues which is a new research direction and can be applied to many applications. In this paper, we formally give the definition of comparative reasoning and propose several different methods to tackle comparative reasoning in both pairwise and collective cases. The idea of the proposed methods is that we find a knowledge segment from the knowledge graph to best represent the semantic meaning of the given claim, and reasons according to it. We perform extensive empirical evaluations on real-world datasets to demonstrate that the proposed methods have good performances.",

            "abstract": "Bundle recommendation is an emerging research direction in the recommender system with the focus on recommending customized bundles of items for users. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been applied to this problem and achieved superior performance, existing methods underexplore the graph-level GNN methods, which exhibit great potential in traditional recommender system. Furthermore, they usually lack the transferability from one domain with sufficient supervision to another domain which might suffer from the label scarcity issue. In this work, we propose a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network model, SuGeR, for bundle recommendation to handle these limitations. SuGeR generates heterogeneous subgraphs around the user-bundle pairs and then maps those subgraphs to the users' preference predictions via neural relational graph propagation. Experimental results show that SUGER significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in the basic and the transfer bundle recommendation tasks by up to 77.17% by NDCG@40.

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph reasoning plays a pivotal role in many real-world applications, such as network alignment, computational fact-checking, recommendation, and many more. Among these applications, knowledge graph completion (KGC) and multi-hop question answering over knowledge graph (Multi-hop KGQA) are two representative reasoning tasks. In the vast majority of the existing works, the two tasks are considered separately with different models or algorithms. However, we envision that KGC and Multi-hop KGQA are closely related to each other. Therefore, the two tasks will benefit from each other if they are approached adequately. In this work, we propose a neural model named BiNet to jointly handle KGC and multi-hop KGQA, and formulate it as a multi-task learning problem. Specifically, our proposed model leverages a shared embedding space and an answer scoring module, which allows the two tasks to automatically share latent features and learn the interactions between natural language question decoder and answer scoring module. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed BiNet model addresses both multi-hop KGQA and KGC tasks simultaneously with superior performance. Experiment results show that BiNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of KGQA and KGC benchmark datasets.",
