            "abstract": "Recommender System (RS) is ubiquitous on today\u2019s Internet to provide multifaceted personalized information services. While an enormous success has been made in pushing forward high-accuracy recommendations, the other side of the coin \u2014 the recommendation explainability \u2014 needs to be better handled for pursuing persuasiveness, especially for the era of deep learning based recommendation. A few research efforts investigate interpretable recommendation from the feature and result levels. Compared with them, model-level explanation, which unfolds the reasoning process of recommendation through transparent models, still remains underexplored and deserves more attention. In this paper, we propose a model-based explainable recommendation approach, i.e., NS-ICF, which stands for Neuro-Symbolic Interpretable Collaborative Filtering. Thanks to the recent advance on neuro-symbolic computation for automatic rule learning, NS-ICF learns interpretable recommendation rules (consisting of user and item attributes) based on neural networks with two innovations: (1) a three-tower architecture tailored for the user and item sides in the RS domain; (2) fusing the powerful personalized representations of users and items to achieve adaptive rule weights and without sacrificing interpretability. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate NS-ICF is comparable to state-of-the-art deep recommendation models and is transparent for its unique neuro-symbolic architecture.",

            "abstract": "The popularity of smartphones has made it increasingly com\u00acmon to take photos with smartphones. For those who design and develop cameras, as well as those who use cameras, it is advantageous to have a way to assess the image quality of a smartphone camera. On account of the distortion of pictures taken by smartphones is different from that of traditional pic\u00actures, traditional methods of image quality assessment (IQA) cannot be directly applied to pictures taken by smartphones. In this paper, we submit four models for quality assessment of photos taken by smartphones. We use a pre-trained saliency prediction model SalGAN to preprocess data, and extract dif\u00acferent features of the image for different indicators such as exposure, noise, texture, color. Then we input them to the modified Inception network with residual module and batch normalization for training. Our models outperform traditional no-reference IQA methods on the training set. The average SROCC reaches 0.45, 0.36, 0.33, 0.36 for exposure, color, noise, texture respectively.",
