            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) problem, which focuses on next-item prediction for anonymous users, has received increasingly more attention from researchers. Existing graph-based SBR methods all lack the ability to differentiate between sessions with the same last item, and suffer from severe popularity bias. Inspired by nowadays emerging contrastive learning methods, this paper presents a Simple Contrastive Graph Neural Network for Session-based Recommendation (SimCGNN). In SimCGNN, we first obtain normalized session embeddings on constructed session graphs. We next construct positive and negative samples of the sessions by two forward propagation and a novel negative sample selection strategy, and then calculate the constructive loss. Finally, session embeddings are used to give prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-word datasets show our SimCGNN achieves a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.",

Existing methods are often difficult to model the implicit association of multi-modal data with user choices. Moreover, traditional methods struggle to fully explore the variation of user preferences at variable time intervals. To tackle these limitations, we propose a Multi-Modal Temporal Knowledge Graph-aware Sub-graph Embedding approach (Mandari). We first construct a novel Multi-Modal Temporal Knowledge Graph. Based on the proposed knowledge graph, we integrate multi-modal information and leverage the graph attention network to calculate sub-graph prediction probability. Next, we implement a temporal knowledge mining method to model the segmentation and periodicity of user check-in and obtain temporal prediction probability. Finally, we fuse temporal prediction probability with the previous sub-graph prediction probability to obtain the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",

The need for image provenance analysis has never been more timely. Typical applications are content tracking, copyright enforcement, and forensics reasoning. However, large-scale image provenance datasets, which contain diverse manipulation history graphs with various manipulation operations and rich metadata, are still needed to facilitate the research. It is one of the major factors that hinders the development of techniques for image provenance analysis. To address this issue, we introduce large-scale benchmark datasets for provenance analysis, namely Media Forensics Challenge-Provenance (MFC-Prov) datasets. Two provenance tasks are designed along with evaluation metrics. Furthermore, extensive analysis is conducted for system performance in terms of accuracy on our datasets.",

            "abstract": "The conventional works on spatial keyword queries for a knowledge base focus on finding a subtree to cover all the query keywords. The retrieved subtree is rooted at a place vertex, spatially close to a query location and compact in terms of the query keywords. However, user requirements may not be satisfied by a single subtree in some application scenarios. A group of subtrees should be combined together to collectively cover the query keywords. In this paper, we propose and study a novel way of searching on a spatial knowledge, namely collective spatial keyword query on a knowledge base (CoSKQ-KB). We formalize the problem of CoSKQ-KB and design a baseline method for CoSKQ-KB (BCK). To further speed up the query processing, an improved scalable method for CoSKQ-KB (iSCK) is proposed based on a set of efficient pruning and early termination techniques. In addition, we conduct empirical experiments on two real-world datasets to show the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.",

In this paper, we use multimodal data and propose a novel face-pose estimation framework named multitask manifold deep learning (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{M}^2\\text{DL}$</tex-math></inline-formula>). It is based on feature extraction with improved convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multimodal mapping relationship with multitask learning. In the proposed CNNs, manifold regularized convolutional layers learn the relationship between outputs of neurons in a low-rank space. Besides, in the proposed mapping relationship learning method, different modals of face representations are naturally combined by applying multitask learning with incoherent sparse and low-rank learning with a least-squares loss.

            "abstract": "A large number of spatial knowledge graphs (SKGs) are available from spatially enriched knowledge bases, e.g., DBpedia and YAGO2. This provides a great chance to understand valuable information about the regions surrounding us. However, it is hard to comprehend SKGs due to the explosively growing volume and the complication of the graph structures. Thus we study the problem of similar region search (SRS), which is an easy-to-use but effective way to explore spatial data. The effectiveness of SRS highly depends on how to measure the region similarity. However, existing approaches cannot make use of the rich information contained in SKGs thus may lead to incorrect results. In this paper, we propose a spatial knowledge representation learning method for region similarity, namely SKRL4RS. SKRL4RS firstly encodes the spatial entities of an SKG into a vector space to make it easier to extract useful features. Then regions are represented by 3-D tensors using the spatial entity embeddings together with geographical information. Finally, region tensors are fed into the conventional triplet network to learn the feature vectors of regions. The region similarity measure learned by SKRL4RS can capture the hierarchical types, semantic relatedness, and relative locations of spatial entities inside a region. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our SKRL4RS outperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin in terms of the accuracy of measuring region similarity.",

            "abstract": "Recently, the emerging Social Internet of Things (SIoT) has opened up a myriad of research opportunities. One of the most fundamental research challenges posed by SIoT and its objective is to allow smart objects to create and maintain their own social networks. In this paper, we are interested in constructing these social networks, which are built upon social relationships between smart objects, and quantitatively estimating the social strength values of the relations. In particular, we propose a model named social strength prediction model, which infers social connections among smart objects and predicts the strength of the connections using the co-usage data of the objects. The proposed model is divided into two major components: 1) entropy-based and 2) distance-based social strength computations. The two components capture different properties of co-usages of objects, namely, the diversity and spatiotemporal features, which are all essential factors that contribute to the values of social strength. In order to test the feasibility of the proposed model, we conducted extensive sets of experiments with real-world datasets, which include the history data of various object usages. Based on the results, we show that the proposed model is in fact capable of inferring social connections and predicting their corresponding social strength with relatively high precision and recall.",

            "abstract": "Human face pose estimation aims at estimating the gazing direction or head postures with 2D images. It gives some very important information such as communicative gestures, saliency detection and so on, which attracts plenty of attention recently. However, it is challenging because of complex background, various orientations and face appearance visibility. Therefore, a descriptive representation of face images and mapping it to poses are critical. In this paper, we make use of multi-modal data and propose a novel face pose estimation method that uses a novel deep learning framework named Multi-task Manifold Deep Learning $M^2DL$. It is based on feature extraction with improved deep neural networks and multi-modal mapping relationship with multi-task learning. In the proposed deep learning based framework, Manifold Regularized Convolutional Layers (MRCL) improve traditional convolutional layers by learning the relationship among outputs of neurons. Besides, in the proposed mapping relationship learning method, different modals of face representations are naturally combined to learn the mapping function from face images to poses. In this way, the computed mapping model with multiple tasks is improved. Experimental results on three challenging benchmark datasets DPOSE, HPID and BKHPD demonstrate the outstanding performance of $M^2DL$.",

            "abstract": "The W3C RDF Stream Processing (RSP) community has proposed a common model and a language for querying RDF streams. However, the current RSP systems significantly differ from each other in terms of performance. In this paper, we propose a unified interface for optimizing a continuous query in heterogeneous RSP systems. To enhance the performance of RSP, a unified interface decomposes a query, reassembles partial queries and assigns them to appropriate RSP systems. Experimental results show that the proposed approach performs better in terms of memory consumption and latency.",
