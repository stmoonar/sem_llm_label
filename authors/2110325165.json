            "title": "A Reinforcement Learning Based Two-Stage Model for Emotion Cause Pair Extraction",
            "abstract": "Recently, many efforts have been devoted to promoting the Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) task, as jointly extracting emotions and their causes is considered more helpful than only identifying the emotions in many applications. Among the existing efforts, end-to-end approaches are getting popular as the main trend, while others like pipeline models have been overlooked due to their potential issues of cascading errors. Nevertheless, the advantages of the pipeline models, such as logically dividing a complicated task into multiple easier subtasks, are underestimated and not well exploited. Moreover, the existing end-to-end approaches fail to capture the implicit co-occurrence or exclusion patterns between multiple pairs of emotions and causes since they are extracted independently. In view of these limitations, we propose a novel two-stage model to address the ECPE task and incorporate reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle the cascading error issue. In particular, our two-stage model first detects emotion clauses and then recognizes cause clauses for each detected emotion clause sequentially. By representing the error of each decision as an explicit reward, our model clearly knows how the error at each stage affects the final performance, hence the model can adjust itself for better performance. Furthermore, the sequential prediction enables our model to use the results achieved in the previous stages as auxiliary information in the subsequent stages. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed two-stage model, and the ablation comparison shows the promising effect of reducing cascading errors by incorporating RL.",

            "abstract": "The study of causal relationships between emotions and causes in texts has recently received much attention. Most works focus on extracting causally related clauses from documents. However, none of these works has considered that the causal relationships among the extracted emotion and cause clauses can only be valid under some specific context clauses. To highlight the context in such special causal relationships, we propose a new task to determine whether or not an input pair of emotion and cause has a valid causal relationship under different contexts and extract the specific context clauses that participate in the causal relationship. Since the task is new for which no existing dataset is available, we conduct manual annotation on a benchmark dataset to obtain the labels for our tasks and the annotations of each context clause's type that can also be used in some other applications. We adopt negative sampling to construct the final dataset to balance the number of documents with and without causal relationships. Based on the constructed dataset, we propose an end-to-end multi-task framework, where we design two novel and general modules to handle the two goals of our task. Specifically, we propose a context masking module to extract the context clauses participating in the causal relationships. We propose a prediction aggregation module to fine-tune the prediction results according to whether the input emotion and causes depend on specific context clauses. Results of extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our proposed framework.",

            "abstract": "As widely used in data-driven decision-making, recommender systems have been recognized for their capabilities to provide users with personalized services in many user-oriented online services, such as E-commerce (e.g., Amazon, Taobao, etc.) and Social Media sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). Recent works have shown that deep neural networks-based recommender systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where adversaries can inject carefully crafted fake user profiles (i.e., a set of items that fake users have interacted with) into a target recommender system to promote or demote a set of target items. Instead of generating users with fake profiles from scratch, in this article, we introduce a novel strategy to obtain \u201cfake\u201d user profiles via copying cross-domain user profiles, where a reinforcement learning based black-box attacking framework (CopyAttack+) is developed to effectively and efficiently select cross-domain user profiles from the source domain to attack the target system. Moreover, we propose to train a local surrogate system for mimicking adversarial black-box attacks in the source domain, so as to provide transferable signals with the purpose of enhancing the attacking strategy in the target black-box recommender system. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacking framework.",

            "title": "Jointly Attacking Graph Neural Network and its Explanations",
            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have boosted the performance for many graph-related tasks. Despite the great success, recent studies have shown that GNNs are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where adversaries can mislead the GNNs' prediction by modifying graphs. On the other hand, the explanation of GNNs (GnnExplainer for short) provides a better understanding of a trained GNN model by generating a small subgraph and features that are most influential for its prediction. In this paper, we first perform empirical studies to validate that GnnExplainer can act as an inspection tool and have the potential to detect the adversarial perturbations for graphs. This finding motivates us to further investigate a new problem: Whether a graph neural network and its explanations can be jointly attacked by modifying graphs with malicious desires? It is challenging to answer this question since the goals of adversarial attack and bypassing the GnnExplainer essentially contradict with each other. In this work, we give a confirmative answer for this question by proposing a novel attack framework (GEAttack) for graphs, which can attack both a GNN model and its explanations by exploiting their vulnerabilities simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first effort to attack both GNNs and explanations on graph-structured data for the trustworthiness of GNNs. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) aims at extracting emotions and causes as pairs from documents, where each pair contains an emotion clause and a set of cause clauses. Existing approaches address the task by first extracting emotion and cause clauses via two binary classifiers separately, and then training another binary classifier to pair them up. However, the extracted emotion-cause pairs of different emotion types cannot be distinguished from each other through simple binary classifiers, which limits the applicability of the existing approaches. Moreover, such two-step approaches may suffer from possible cascading errors. In this paper, to address the first problem, we assign emotion type labels to emotion and cause clauses so that emotion-cause pairs of different emotion types can be easily distinguished. As for the second problem, we reformulate the ECPE task as a unified sequence labeling task, which can extract multiple emotion-cause pairs in an end-to-end fashion. We propose an approach composed of a convolution neural network for encoding neighboring information and two Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory networks for two auxiliary tasks. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approaches.",

In this paper, we propose an approach called MetaMix, which generates virtual feature-target pairs within each episode to regularize the backbone models. MetaMix can be integrated with any of the MAML-based algorithms and learn the decision boundaries generalizing better to new tasks.

            "abstract": "Recommender systems, which aim to suggest personalized lists of items for users, have drawn a lot of attention. In fact, many of these state-of-the-art recommender systems have been built on deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent studies have shown that these deep neural networks are vulnerable to attacks, such as data poisoning, which generate fake users to promote a selected set of items. Correspondingly, effective defense strategies have been developed to detect these generated users with fake profiles. Thus, new strategies of creating more \u2018realistic\u2019 user profiles to promote a set of items should be investigated to further understand the vulnerability of DNNs based recommender systems. In this work, we present a novel framework CopyAttack. It is a reinforcement learning based black-box attacking method that harnesses real users from a source domain by copying their profiles into the target domain with the goal of promoting a subset of items. CopyAttack is constructed to both efficiently and effectively learn policy gradient networks that first select, then further refine/craft user profiles from the source domain, and ultimately copy them into the target domain. CopyAttack\u2019s goal is to maximize the hit ratio of the targeted items in the Top-k recommendation list of the users in the target domain. We conducted experiments on two real-world datasets and empirically verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The implementation of CopyAttack is available at https://github.com/wenqifan03/CopyAttack.",

            "abstract": "Data in many real-world applications such as social networks, users shopping behaviors, and inter-item relationships can be represented as graphs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great success in learning meaningful representations for graphs by inherently integrating node information and topological structure. Data in social recommendations can also be denotes as graph data in the form of user-user social graphs and user-item graphs. In addition, the relationships between items can be denoted as item-item graphs. GNNs provide an unprecedented opportunity to advance social recommendations. However, there are tremendous challenges in building GNNs-based social recommendations where (1) users (items) are simultaneously involved in the user-item graph and user-user social graph (item-item graph); (2) user-item graphs not only contain user-item interactions but also include users\u2019 opinions on items; and (3) the nature of social relations are heterogeneous among users. In this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network framework (GraphRec+) for social recommendations, which is able to coherently model graph data in order to learn better user and item representations. Specifically, we introduce a principled approach for jointly capturing interactions and opinions in the user-item graph and also propose an attention mechanism to differentiate the heterogeneous strengths of social relations. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

            "title": "Deep social collaborative filtering",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems are crucial to alleviate the information overload problem in online worlds. Most of the modern recommender systems capture users' preference towards items via their interactions based on collaborative filtering techniques. In addition to the user-item interactions, social networks can also provide useful information to understand users' preference as suggested by the social theories such as homophily and influence. Recently, deep neural networks have been utilized for social recommendations, which facilitate both the user-item interactions and the social network information. However, most of these models cannot take full advantage of the social network information. They only use information from direct neighbors, but distant neighbors can also provide helpful information. Meanwhile, most of these models treat neighbors' information equally without considering the specific recommendations. However, for a specific recommendation case, the information relevant to the specific item would be helpful. Besides, most of these models do not explicitly capture the neighbor's opinions to items for social recommendations, while different opinions could affect the user differently. In this paper, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose DSCF, a Deep Social Collaborative Filtering framework, which can exploit the social relations with various aspects for recommender systems. Comprehensive experiments on two-real world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",
