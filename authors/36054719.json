            "title": "Addressing Chest Radiograph Projection Bias in Deep Classification Models",
            "abstract": "Deep learning-based models are widely used for disease classification in chest radiographs. This exam can be performed in one of two projections (posteroanterior or anteroposterior), depending on the direction that the X-ray beam travels through the body. Since projection visibly affects the way anatomical structures appear in the scans, it may introduce bias in classifiers, especially when spurious correlations between a given disease and a projection occur. This paper examines the influence of chest radiograph projection on the performance of deep learning-based classification models and proposes an approach to mitigate projection-induced bias. Results show that a DenseNet-121 model is better at classifying images from the most representative projection in the data set, suggesting that projection is taken into account by the classifier. Moreover, this model can classify chest X-ray projection better than any of the fourteen radiological findings considered, without being explicitly trained for that task, putting it at high risk for projection bias. We propose a label-conditional gradient reversal framework to make the model insensitive to projection, by forcing the extracted features to be simultaneously good for disease classification and bad for projection classification, resulting in a framework with reduced projection-induced bias.",

            "abstract": "Explanations of a model's biases or predictions are essential to medical image analysis. Yet, explainable machine learning approaches for medical image analysis are challenged by needs to preserve privacy of patient data, and by current trends in deep learning to use unsustainably large models and large datasets. We propose DeepFixCX for explainable and privacy\u2010preserving medical image compression that is nimble and performant. We contribute a review of the field and a conceptual framework for simultaneous privacy and explainability via tools of compression. DeepFixCX compresses images without learning by removing or obscuring spatial and edge information. DeepFixCX is ante\u2010hoc explainable and gives privatized post hoc explanations of spatial and edge bias without accessing the original image. DeepFixCX privatizes images to prevent image reconstruction and mitigate patient re\u2010identification. DeepFixCX is nimble. Compression can occur on a laptop CPU or GPU to compress and privatize 1700 images per second of size 320\u2009\u00d7\u2009320. DeepFixCX enables use of low memory MLP classifiers for vision data; permitting small performance loss gives end\u2010to\u2010end MLP performance over 70\u00d7 faster and batch size over 100\u00d7 larger. DeepFixCX consistently improves predictive classification performance of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) by 0.02 AUC ROC on Glaucoma and Cervix Type detection datasets, and can improve multi\u2010label chest x\u2010ray classification performance in seven of 10 tested settings. In all three datasets, compression to less than 5% of original number of pixels gives matching or improved performance. Our main novelty is to define an explainability versus privacy problem and address it with lossy compression.",

            "abstract": "Nuclear detection, segmentation and morphometric profiling are essential in helping us further understand the relationship between histology and patient outcome. To drive innovation in this area, we setup a community-wide challenge using the largest available dataset of its kind to assess nuclear segmentation and cellular composition. Our challenge, named CoNIC, stimulated the development of reproducible algorithms for cellular recognition with real-time result inspection on public leaderboards. We conducted an extensive post-challenge analysis based on the top-performing models using 1,658 whole-slide images of colon tissue. With around 700 million detected nuclei per model, associated features were used for dysplasia grading and survival analysis, where we demonstrated that the challenge's improvement over the previous state-of-the-art led to significant boosts in downstream performance. Our findings also suggest that eosinophils and neutrophils play an important role in the tumour microevironment. We release challenge models and WSI-level results to foster the development of further methods for biomarker discovery.",

            "abstract": "The integration of explanation techniques promotes the comprehension of a model\u2019s output and contributes to its interpretation e.g. by generating heat maps highlighting the most decisive regions for that prediction. However, there are several drawbacks to the current heat map-generating methods. Probability by itself is not indicative of the model\u2019s conviction in a prediction, as it is influenced by multiple factors, such as class imbalance. Consequently, it is possible that a model yields two true positive predictions - one with an accurate explanation map, and the other with an inaccurate one. Current state-of-the-art explanations are not able to distinguish both scenarios and alert the user to dubious explanations. The goal of this work is to represent these maps more intuitively based on how confident the model is regarding the diagnosis, by adding an extra validation step over the state-of-the-art results that indicates whether the user should trust the initial explanation or not. The proposed method, Confident-CAM, facilitates the interpretation of the results by measuring the distance between the output probability and the corresponding class threshold, using a confidence score to generate nearly null maps when the initial explanations are most likely incorrect. This study implements and validates the proposed algorithm on a multi-label chest X-ray classification exercise, targeting 14 radiological findings in the ChestX-Ray14 dataset with significant class imbalance. Results indicate that confidence scores can distinguish likely accurate and inaccurate explanations. Code available via GitHub.",

            "title": "MedShapeNet - A Large-Scale Dataset of 3D Medical Shapes for Computer Vision",
            "abstract": "Prior to the deep learning era, shape was commonly used to describe the objects. Nowadays, state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in medical imaging are predominantly diverging from computer vision, where voxel grids, meshes, point clouds, and implicit surface models are used. This is seen from numerous shape-related publications in premier vision conferences as well as the growing popularity of ShapeNet (about 51,300 models) and Princeton ModelNet (127,915 models). For the medical domain, we present a large collection of anatomical shapes (e.g., bones, organs, vessels) and 3D models of surgical instrument, called MedShapeNet, created to facilitate the translation of data-driven vision algorithms to medical applications and to adapt SOTA vision algorithms to medical problems. As a unique feature, we directly model the majority of shapes on the imaging data of real patients. As of today, MedShapeNet includes 23 dataset with more than 100,000 shapes that are paired with annotations (ground truth). Our data is freely accessible via a web interface and a Python application programming interface (API) and can be used for discriminative, reconstructive, and variational benchmarks as well as various applications in virtual, augmented, or mixed reality, and 3D printing. Exemplary, we present use cases in the fields of classification of brain tumors, facial and skull reconstructions, multi-class anatomy completion, education, and 3D printing. In future, we will extend the data and improve the interfaces. The project pages are: https://medshapenet.ikim.nrw/ and https://github.com/Jianningli/medshapenet-feedback",

            "abstract": "Chest radiography is one of the most ubiquitous medical imaging modalities. Nevertheless, the interpretation of chest radiography images is time-consuming, complex and subject to observer variability. As such, automated diagnosis systems for pathology detection have been proposed, aiming to reduce the burden on radiologists. The advent of deep learning has fostered the development of solutions for both abnormality detection with promising results. However, these tools suffer from poor explainability as the reasons that led to a decision cannot be easily understood, representing a major hurdle for their adoption in clinical practice. In order to overcome this issue, a method for chest radiography abnormality detection is presented which relies on an object detection framework to detect individual findings and thus separate normal and abnormal CXRs. It is shown that this framework is capable of an excellent performance in abnormality detection (AUC: 0.993), outperforming other state- of-the-art classification methodologies (AUC: 0.976 using the same classes). Furthermore, validation on external datasets shows that the proposed framework has a smaller drop in performance when applied to previously unseen data (21.9 % vs 23.4 % on average). Several approaches for object detection are compared and it is shown that merging pathology classes to minimize radiologist variability improves the localization of abnormal regions (0.529 vs 0.491 APF when using all pathology classes), resulting in a network which is more explainable and thus more suitable for integration in clinical practice.",

            "abstract": "The development of accurate methods for OCT image analysis is highly dependent on the availability of large annotated datasets. As such datasets are usually expensive and hard to obtain, novel approaches based on deep generative models have been proposed for data augmentation. In this work, a flow-based network (SRFlow) and a generative adversarial network (ESRGAN) are used for synthesizing high-resolution OCT B-scans from low-resolution versions of real OCT images. The quality of the images generated by the two models is assessed using two standard fidelity-oriented metrics and a learned perceptual quality metric. The performance of two classification models trained on real and synthetic images is also evaluated. The obtained results show that the images generated by SRFlow preserve higher fidelity to the ground truth, while the outputs of ESRGAN present, on average, better perceptual quality. Independently of the architecture of the network chosen to classify the OCT B-scans, the model's performance always improves when images generated by SRFlow are included in the training set.",

            "abstract": "The importance of X-Ray imaging analysis is paramount for health care institutions since it is the main imaging modality for patient diagnosis, and deep learning can be used to aid clinicians in image diagnosis or structure segmentation. In recent years, several articles demonstrate the capability that deep learning models have in classifying and segmenting chest x-ray images if trained in an annotated dataset. Unfortunately, for segmentation tasks, only a few relatively small datasets have annotations, which poses a problem for the training of robust deep learning strategies. In this work, a semi-supervised approach is developed which consists of using available information regarding other anatomical structures to guide the segmentation when the groundtruth segmentation for a given structure is not available. This semi-supervised is compared with a fully- supervised approach for the tasks of lung segmentation and for multi-structure segmentation (lungs, heart and clavicles) in chest x-ray images. The semi-supervised lung predictions are evaluated visually and show relevant improvements, therefore this approach could be used to improve performance in external datasets with missing groundtruth. The multi-structure predictions show an improvement in mean absolute and Hausdorff distances when compared to a fully supervised approach and visual analysis of the segmentations shows that false positive predictions are removed. In conclusion, the developed method results in a new strategy that can help solve the problem of missing annotations and increase the quality of predictions in new datasets.",

ExplainFix adopts two design principles: the \u201cfixed filters\u201d principle that all spatial filter weights of convolutional neural networks can be fixed at initialization and never learned, and the \u201cnimbleness\u201d principle that only few network parameters suffice. We contribute (a) visual model\u2010based explanations, (b) speed and accuracy gains, and (c) novel tools for deep convolutional neural networks. ExplainFix gives key insights that spatially fixed networks should have a steered initialization, that spatial convolution layers tend to prioritize low frequencies, and that most network parameters are not necessary in spatially fixed models. ExplainFix models have up to \u00d7100 fewer spatial filter kernels than fully learned models and matching or improved accuracy. Our extensive empirical analysis confirms that ExplainFix guarantees nimbler models (train up to 17% faster with channel pruning), matching or improved predictive performance (spanning 13 distinct baseline models, four architectures and two medical image datasets), improved robustness to larger learning rate, and robustness to varying model size. We are first to demonstrate that all spatial filters in state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art convolutional deep networks can be fixed at initialization, not learned.",

            "abstract": "Backed by more powerful computational resources and optimized training routines, deep learning models have attained unprecedented performance in extracting information from chest X-ray data. Preceding other tasks, an automated abnormality detection stage can be useful to prioritize certain exams and enable a more efficient clinical workflow. However, the presence of image artifacts such as lettering often generates a harmful bias in the classifier, leading to an increase of false positive results. Consequently, health care would benefit from a system that selects the thoracic region of interest prior to deciding whether an image is possibly pathologic. The current work tack-les this binary classification exercise using an attention-driven and spatially unsupervised Spatial Transformer Network (STN). The results indicate that the STN achieves similar results to using YOLO-cropped images, with fewer computational expenses and without the need for localization labels. More specifically, the system is able to distinguish between normal and abnormal CheXpert Images with a mean AUC of 84.22%.",
