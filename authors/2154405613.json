            "title": "OpenSiteRec: An Open Dataset for Site Recommendation",
            "abstract": "As a representative information retrieval task, site recommendation, which aims at predicting the optimal sites for a brand or an institution to open new branches in an automatic data-driven way, is beneficial and crucial for brand development in modern business. However, there is no publicly available dataset so far and most existing approaches are limited to an extremely small scope of brands, which seriously hinders the research on site recommendation. Therefore, we collect, construct and release an open comprehensive dataset, namely OpenSiteRec, to facilitate and promote the research on site recommendation. Specifically, OpenSiteRec leverages a heterogeneous graph schema to represent various types of real-world entities and relations in four international metropolises. To evaluate the performance of the existing general methods on the site recommendation task, we conduct benchmarking experiments of several representative recommendation models on OpenSiteRec. Furthermore, we also highlight the potential application directions to demonstrate the wide applicability of OpenSiteRec. We believe that our OpenSiteRec dataset is significant and anticipated to encourage the development of advanced methods for site recommendation. OpenSiteRec is available online at https://OpenSiteRec.github.io/.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid development of WWW, grid and IPv6, more and more collaborative science and technology research systems and applications have been built on Internet in many countries. SOA and Web2.0 bring new opportunities for collaboration in scientific research. We construct a digital collaborative R&D Platform for TNList (Tsinghua National Library for Information Science and Technology). This platform includes four layers: portal, collaboration, resource management and infrastructure (grid and IPv6). Based on SOA and Web2.0, we develop the main components of platform to provide a digital collaborative environment",
