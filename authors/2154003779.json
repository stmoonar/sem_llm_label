            "abstract": "Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is a promising technology that can potentially mitigate the energy provisioning problem for sensor networks. In order to efficiently replenish energy for these battery-powered devices, designing appropriate scheduling and charging path planning algorithms is essential and challenging. Whilst previous studies have tackled this challenge, the conjoint influences of network topology, charging path planning, and energy threshold distribution in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) are still in their infancy. We mitigate the aforementioned problem by proposing novel algorithmic solutions to efficient sector-based on-demand charging scheduling and path planning. Specifically, we first propose a hexagonal cluster-based deployment of nodes such that finding an NP-Complete Hamiltonian path is feasible. Second, each cluster is divided into multiple sectors and a charging path planning algorithm is implemented to yield a Hamiltonian path, aimed at improving the Mobile Charging Vehicle (MCV) efficiency and charging throughput. Third, we propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the importance of nodes to be used for charging duration decision-making and prioritization. Fourth, a non-preemptive dynamic priority scheduling algorithm is proposed for charging tasks\u2019 assignments and scheduling. Finally, extensive simulations have been conducted, revealing the significant advantages of our proposed algorithms in terms of energy efficiency, response time, dead nodes\u2019 density, and queuing processing.",

            "abstract": "Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia and a leading cause of death. Brain stroke and brain atrophy are the major degenerative pathologies associated with vascular dementia. Timely detection of these progressive pathologies is critical to avoid brain damage. Brain imaging is an important diagnostic tool and determines future treatment options available to the patient. Traditional medical technologies are expensive, require extensive supervision and are not easily accessible. This article presents a novel concept of low- complexity wearable sensing system for the detection of brain stroke and brain atrophy using RF sensors. This multimodal RF sensing system provides a first-of-its-kind RF sensing solution for the detection of cerebral blood density variations and blood clots at an initial stage of neurodegeneration. A customized microwave imaging algorithm is presented for the reconstruction of images in affected areas of the brain. Designs are validated using software simulations and hardware modeling. Fabricated sensors are experimentally validated and can effectively detect blood density variation (1050 \u00b1 50 Kg/m3), artificial stroke targets with a volume of 27 mm3 and density of 1025\u20131050 Kg/m3, and brain atrophy with a cavity of 58 mm3 within a realistic brain phantom. The safety of the proposed wearable RF sensing system is studied through the evaluation of the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR < 1.4 W/Kg, 100 mW) and thermal conductivity of the brain (<0.152 \u00b0C). The results indicate that the device is viable as an efficient, portable, and low-cost substitute for vascular dementia detection.",

This paper proposes a real\u2010time lane detection network (TSA\u2010LNet) that incorporates a lightweight network (LNet) and a two\u2010directional separation attention (TSA) to enhance the lane detection capability of autonomous vehicles. By adopting the attention mechanism, the real\u2010time performance and detection accuracy are significantly improved. Specifically, LNet employs symmetry layer to drastically reduce the number of parameters and the network's running time. TSA infers the attention map along two separate directions, transverse and longitudinal, and performs adaptive feature refinement by multiplying the attention map with the input feature map. TSA can be integrated into LNet to capture the local textural and global contextual information of lanes without increasing the processing time. Results on popular benchmarks demonstrate that TSA\u2010LNet achieves outstanding detection accuracy and faster speed (6.99 ms per image). Additionally, TSA\u2010LNet exhibits excellent robustness in real\u2010world scenarios.",

            "title": "A Novel Homomorphic Encryption and Consortium Blockchain-Based Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Industrial Internet of Medical Things",
            "abstract": "Securing Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is one of the most critical applications of cryptography over the Internet due to the value and importance of data contained in such EMRs. Although blockchain-based healthcare systems can provide security, privacy, and immutability to EMRs, several outstanding security and latency issues are associated with existing schemes. For example, some researchers have used the blockchain as a storage tool which increases delay and adversely affects the blockchain performance since it stores a copy of each transaction. A distributed ledger also requires appropriate space and computational power with increased data size. In addition, existing healthcare-based approaches usually rely on centralized servers connected to clouds, which are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS), distributed DoS (DDoS), and collusion attacks. This paper proposes a novel hybrid-deep learning-based homomorphic encryption (HE) model for the Industrial Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) to cope with such challenges using a consortium blockchain. Integrating HE with the proposed IIoMT system is a vital contribution of this work. The use of HE while outsourcing to the cloud the storage provides a unique facility to perform any statistical and machine learning operation on the encrypted EMR data, hence providing resistance to collusion and phishing attacks. Our proposed model uses a pre-trained hybrid deep learning model in the cloud and deploys the trained model into blockchain-based edge devices in order to classify and train local models using EMRs. This is further conditioned on the private data of each edge and IoT device connected with the consortium blockchain. All local models obtained are aggregated to the cloud to update a global model, which is finally disseminated to the edge nodes. Our proposed approach provides more privacy and security than conventional models and can deliver high efficiency and low end-to-end latency for users. Comparative simulation analysis with state-of-the-art approaches is carried out using benchmark performance metrics, which show that our proposed model provides enhanced security, efficiency, and transparency.",

            "abstract": "Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm that exposes Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) to road scenarios. In VEC, task offloading can enable vehicles to offload the computing tasks to nearby Roadside Units (RSUs) that deploy computing capabilities. However, the highly dynamic network topology, strict low-delay constraints, and massive data of tasks of VEC pose significant challenges for implementing efficient offloading. Digital Twin-based VEC is emerging as a promising solution that enables real-time monitoring of the state of the VEC network through mapping and interaction between the physical and virtual worlds, thus assisting in making sound offload decisions in the physical world. Thus, this paper proposes an intelligent partial offloading scheme, namely, Digital Twin-Assisted Intelligent Partial Offloading (IGNITE). First, to find the optimal offloading space in advance, we combine the improved clustering algorithm with the Digital Twin (DT) technique, in which unreasonable decisions can be avoided by reducing the size of the decision space. Second, to reduce the overall cost of the system, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is employed to train the offloading strategy, allowing for automatic optimization of computational delay and vehicle service price. To improve the efficiency of cooperation between digital and physical spaces, a feedback mechanism is established. It can adjust the parameters of the clustering algorithm based on the final offloading results in this clustering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on DT-assisted vehicle offloading that proposes a feedback mechanism, forming a complete closed loop as prediction-offloading-feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IGNITE has significant advantages in terms of total system computational cost, total computational delay, and offloading success rate compared with its counterparts.",

            "abstract": "Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia prevalent in old age groups, and is also one of the leading causes of mortality. Timely diagnosis and detection of vascular dementia is critical to avoid brain damage. Brain imaging is an essential tool for diagnosis and determines future treatment options available to the patient. Currently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Computerized Tomography (CT) scan and carotid ultrasound are mainly used for brain imaging and vascular dementia diagnosis. However, these technologies are expensive, require extensive medical supervision and are not easily accessible. This can cause substantial delay in diagnosis and potentially lead to irreversible damage. This paper presents a first-of-its-kind, miniaturized octagonal monopole-patch antenna (OMPA) sensor for vascular dementia detection. It is designed to operate as part of a portable device and can effectively diagnose underlying causes like brain infarction, stroke and blood clots at the initial stage. The developed sensor designs are validated using microwave computational software and fabricated models are experimentally verified using artificial stroke and blood clot targets inside an artificial brain model. Simulated and measured reflection coefficient results are consistent, and target objects are detected successfully. The findings show that the prototype device is viable as an efficient, portable and low-cost alternate for vascular dementia detection.",

            "abstract": "Online social networks have grown exponentially in the recent years while finding applications in real life like marketing, recommendation systems, and social awareness campaigns. An important research area in this field is Influence Maximization, which pertains to finding methods for maximizing the spread of information (influence) across an OSN. Existing works in IM widely use a pre\u2010defined edge propagation probability for node activation. Hurst exponent (H), which depicts the self\u2010similarity in the time series depicting a user's past interaction behaviour, has also been used as activation criteria. In this work, we propose a Time Series Characteristic based Hurst\u2010based Diffusion Model (TSC\u2010HDM), which calculates H based on the stationary or non\u2010stationary characteristic of the time series. TSC\u2010HDM selects a handful of seed nodes and activates a seed node's inactive successor only if H\u2009>\u20090.5. The proposed model has been tested on four real\u2010world OSN datasets. The results have been compared against four other IM models \u2013 Independent Cascade, Weighted Cascade, Trivalency, and Hurst\u2010based Influence Maximization. TSC\u2010HDM is found to have achieved as much as 590% higher expected influence spread as compared to the other models. Moreover, TSC\u2010HDM has attained 344% better average influence spread than other state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art models namely LIR, A\u2010Greedy, LPIMA, Genetic Algorithm with Dynamic Probabilities, NeighborsRemove, DegreeDecrease, IGIM, IRR, and PHG.",

            "title": "Adaptive Modulation Based on Nondata-Aided Error Vector Magnitude for Smart Systems in Smart Cities",
            "abstract": "A smart city involves big data transmission (BDT) between smart systems, which increases queue delays and leads to difficulty in enhancing the spectral efficiency. Adaptive modulation is an effective technique for enhancing data transmission rates in smart systems. However, traditional adaptive modulation approaches are not suitable for BDT in smart systems because the delays caused by the large amount of transmitted data lead to difficulty in evaluating the channel quality. In this article, we propose a nondata-aided error vector (NDA-EVM) that can be employed in adaptive modulation over wireless channels. The proposed NDA-EVM can be used to evaluate the channel quality and symbol error rate (SER), which reflect the quality of service (QoS) of the system. We formulated the relationship between the NDA-EVM and SER, which provides a basis for designing adaptive modulation techniques for smart systems. To address the low average spectrum efficiency (ASE) caused by BDT queue delays, an adaptive modulation strategy based on the finite-state Markov chain (FSMC) of the NDA-EVM [i.e., NDA-EVM adaptive modulation (NDA-EVM-AM)] was designed. This method simplifies the adaptive modulation algorithm for smart systems to search for the optimal transfer probability in the FSMC matrix based on two typical states: 1) the resident state and 2) transient state. Moreover, we proposed an analytical procedure to describe queuing behavior to analyze the performance of the NDA-EVM-AM algorithm for smart systems in smart cities. The performance is compared with that of a conventional adaptive modulation algorithm through simulations. The results show that compared with traditional adaptive modulation, NDA-EVM-AM obtains a lower packet loss rate and higher spectral efficiency for smart systems.",

            "title": "Unlocking the Potential of Two-Point Cells for Energy-Efficient and Resilient Training of Deep Nets",
            "abstract": "Context-sensitive two-point layer 5 pyramidal cells (L5PCs) were discovered as long ago as 1999. However, the potential of this discovery to provide useful neural computation has yet to be demonstrated. Here we show for the first time how a transformative L5PCs-driven deep neural network (DNN), termed the multisensory cooperative computing (MCC) architecture, can effectively process large amounts of heterogeneous real-world audio-visual (AV) data, using far less energy compared to best available \u2018point\u2019 neuron-driven DNNs. A novel highly-distributed parallel implementation on a Xilinx UltraScale+ MPSoC device estimates energy savings up to 245759 \u00d7 50000 $\\mu$J (i.e., 62% less than the baseline model in a semi-supervised learning setup) where a single synapse consumes $8e^{-5}\\mu$J. In a supervised learning setup, the energy-saving can potentially reach up to 1250x less (per feedforward transmission) than the baseline model. The significantly reduced neural activity in MCC leads to inherently fast learning and resilience against sudden neural damage. This remarkable performance in pilot experiments demonstrates the embodied neuromorphic intelligence of our proposed cooperative L5PC that receives input from diverse neighbouring neurons as context to amplify the transmission of most salient and relevant information for onward transmission, from overwhelmingly large multimodal information utilised at the early stages of on-chip training. Our proposed approach opens new cross-disciplinary avenues for future on-chip DNN training implementations and posits a radical shift in current neuromorphic computing paradigms.",
