            "abstract": "The explosive growth of geospatial data makes the application services based on WebGIS face the challenges of computing intensive and concurrency intensive. This paper proposes to apply the edge cloud computing platform to WebGIS services to solve the problems of insufficient bandwidth and computing delay in GIS applications. In this paper, KubeEdge platform is used as the basic architecture support, and it is oriented to WebGIS based oilfield production management system to realize the edge computing of convective spatial big data and relieve the intensive computing pressure of underlying data in GIS system.",
