            "abstract": "The rapid expansion of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) necessitates the digitization of industrial processes in order to increase network efficiency. The integration of Digital Twin (DT) with IIoT digitizes physical objects into virtual representations to improve data analytics performance. Nevertheless, DT empowered IIoT generates a massive amount of data that is mostly sent to the cloud or edge servers for real-time analysis. However, unreliable public communication channels and lack of trust among participating entities causes various types of threats and attacks on the ongoing communication. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, we present a blockchain and Deep Learning (DL) integrated framework for delivering decentralized data processing and learning in IIoT network. The framework first present a new DT model that facilitates construction of a virtual environment to simulate and replicate security-critical processes of IIoT. Second, we propose a blockchain-based data transmission scheme that uses smart contracts to ensure integrity and authenticity of data. Finally, the DL scheme is designed to apply the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) against valid data retrieved from blockchain. In DL scheme, a Long Short Term Memory-Sparse AutoEncoder (LSTMSAE) technique is proposed to learn the spatial-temporal representation. The extracted characteristics are further used by the proposed Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) algorithm to learn long-distance features and accurately detect attacks. The practical implementation of our proposed framework proves considerable enhancement of communication security and data privacy in DT empowered IIoT network.",

            "abstract": "As network slicing is the chief enabler for future Beyond 5G(B5G) and 6G networks, multiple tenants interoperate cost-effectively to provide a variety of slice services on a common physical infrastructure. However, this opens the doors to cross-slice disruptions with Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack which ultimately disrupts the slice services in the data plane. In this paper, we address such possible cross-network slice disruptions in a zero-trust and multi-tenant based 5G network by proposing different design techniques namely, secure communication and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based anomaly detection to prevent them. Our experiments on a 5G testbed prototype show that in the secure communication method, Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) provides higher security benefits in confidentiality and implicit authorization. However, symmetric encryption and integrity protection prevent cross-slice disruptions with less communication overhead, but with a weaker security level. On the other hand, with online learning and noise tolerance capabilities, AI-based Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) can proactively detect the occurrences of the identified cross-slice disruptions.",

            "title": "5G on the Roads: Latency-Optimized Federated Analytics in the Vehicular Edge",
            "abstract": "Coordination among vehicular actors becomes increasingly important at the dawn of autonomous driving. With communication serving as the basis for this process, latency emerges as a critical limiting factor in information gathering, processing, and redistribution. While these processes have further implications on data privacy, they are also fundamental in safety and efficiency aspects. In this work, we target exactly these areas: we propose a privacy-preserving system for collecting and sharing data in high-mobility automotive environments that aims to minimize the latency of these processes. Namely, we focus on keeping high definition maps (highly accurate environmental and road maps with dynamic information) up-to-date in a crowd-sourced fashion. We employ federated analytics for privacy-preserving, low-latency, scalable processing and data distribution running over a two-tiered infrastructural layout consisting of mobile vehicular nodes and static nodes leveraging the low latency, high throughput and broadcast capabilities of the 5G edge. We take advantage of this setup by proposing queuing theory based analytical models and optimizations to minimize information delivery latency. As our numerical simulations over wide parameter-ranges indicate, the latency of timely data distribution can be decreased only with careful system planning and 5G infrastructure. We obtain the optimal latency characteristics in densely populated central metropolitan scenarios when Gb/s uplink speeds are achievable and the coverage area (map segment size) can reach a diameter of 1km.",

            "abstract": "While 5G can provide high-speed Internet connectivity and over-the-horizon control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), authentication becomes a key security component in 5G-enabled UAVs. This is due to fact that the communicating entities in the network mostly uses unsecured communication channel to exchange critical surveillance data. Authentication thus plays a crucial role in the 5G-enabled UAV network, providing a range of security services such as credential privacy, Session-Key (SK) security, and secure mutual authentication. However, transparency, anonymity, traceability and centralized control are few major security requirements that cannot be fulfilled by the traditional authentication schemes. One of the upcoming technologies that can provide a solution for present centralized 5G-enabled UAV network is blockchain-based authentication scheme. Motivated from aforementioned discussion, this paper presents a Permissioned Blockchain empowered Secure Authentication and Key Agreement framework in 5G-enabled UAVs. In this framework, first an authentication phase between UAV-to-UAV, UAV-to-Edge Server (ES) and Edge-to-Cloud Server (CS) supporting mutual authentication and key agreement is proposed. The authenticated surveillance data collected from UAV is used by the peer-to-peer CS for transaction verification, block creation and addition using smart contract-based consensus mechanism. The practical implementation of framework shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "The recent adaption of virtualization technologies in the next generation mobile network enables 5G base station to be segregated into a Radio Unit (RU), a Distributed Unit (DU), and a Central Unit (CU) to support Cloud based Radio Access Networks (C-RAN). RU and DU are connected through a fronthaul link. In contrast, CU and DU are connected through a midhaul link. Although virtualization of CU gives benefits of centralization to the operators, there are other issues to be solved such as optimization of midhaul bandwidth and computing resources at edge cloud and central cloud where the DUs and CUs are deployed, respectively. In this paper, we propose a dynamic functional split selection for the DUs in 5G C-RAN by adopting to traffic heterogeneity where the midhaul bandwidth is limited. We propose an optimization problem that maximizes the centralization of the C-RAN system by operating more number of DUs on split Option-7 by changing the channel bandwidth of the DUs. The dynamic selection of split options among each CU-DU pair gives 90% centralization over the static functional split for a given midhaul bandwidth.",

            "abstract": "Service function chaining of network-functions across multiple domains enables next-generation services to be offered efficiently. Multi-domain orchestrator decouples the complexities of setting up such chains across domains on behalf of the users of the service. Privacy preservation is essential in this scenario since domains do not want to expose their topology, available resources, cost, and other operational aspects. Similarly, users try to minimize the exposure of their requirements to the domains and the orchestrator. Prior work relied on abstraction and/or aggregation of information in advertisements to preserve privacy. This paper presents a novel cryptographic mechanism based on bilinear mapping that allows the domains and users to privately advertise their information without revealing anything to the orchestrator and other domains. A private set intersection is used to compute the common elements between domains and users. Security proof for the proposed flows is provided using the universally composable framework. Usage of cryptographic techniques reduces the need for abstraction and provides strong privacy guarantees quantified in the privacy metrics of the paper. The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed system is at par with other existing work while providing strong cryptographic privacy, which none of the other systems provide.",

Focusing only on one goal as revenue maximization or cost minimization may not generate the highest profit for infrastructure providers in the long run. In this paper we jointly consider online admission and placement of Radio Access Network (RAN) slices with two objectives - a) maximizing revenue from accepting slices which are more profitable in the long run, and b) minimizing the cost to deploy them in Open RAN (O-RAN) enabled network by placing the slices efficiently. We formulate it as an optimization problem and propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solution using Proximal Policy optimization (PPO). We compare our model with a state-of-the-art DRL based admission control solution and a greedy heuristic. We show that our proposed solution can efficiently adapt to dynamic load conditions. We also show that the proposed solution results in better performance to maximize the overall profit for infrastructure providers in comparison to the baselines.",

            "title": "Proactive Clustering of Base Stations in 5GC-RAN using Cellular Traffic Prediction",
            "abstract": "The rapid growth in mobile network traffic and dynamic user mobility patterns have propelled network operators toward the Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) to reduce operational costs and improve service quality. C-RAN handles the traffic and mobility issues in a centralized manner by segregating the central units (CUs) from the distributed units (DUs) in a shared CU pool. The ability of C-RAN to map multiple DUs to the same CU allows optimal coverage with high multiplexing gains, using the least number of CUs. However, dynamically mapping DUs to CUs is not trivial since the network traffic and mobility patterns are difficult to predict. This paper presents a two-phase framework for an optimal city-wide C-RAN network. In the first phase, we propose to use the ConvLSTM model, which simultaneously learns the hidden spatial and temporal dependencies in a real-world dataset and makes accurate traffic forecasts for a future duration of time. In the second phase, we use the predicted traffic from the first phase to develop a proactive optimal DU-CU clustering scheme that is cost-effective and meets quality objectives. We first formulate an optimization problem, and later, to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization, we propose a lightweight heuristic algorithm. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our prediction model and the mapping scheme using a two-month real-world mobile network dataset of Milan, Italy. Based on simulation results of phase one, we observe the ConvLSTM model, when deployed in a C-RAN architecture, outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction models with up to 26% better RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and up to 36% better MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) values. Similarly, in phase two, our simulation results show that compared to reactive threshold-based clustering, proactive clustering can reduce the average number of active CU servers by up to 18% every 10 minutes without overloading.",

            "title": "NUMASFP: NUMA-Aware Dynamic Service Function Chain Placement in Multi-Core Servers",
            "abstract": "Many prior works investigated service function chain (SFC) placement in multi-core NFV servers with an assumption of treating all CPU cores equal. However, sophisticated servers follow non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture in which CPU cores are distributed across different NUMA nodes to enhance scalability. Our preliminary experiments show that placing VNFs in arbitrarily selected cores can degrade SFC performance, owing to contention for system resources at intra-node and inter-node levels. To handle the aforementioned problem, we study the impact of placing SFCs in a server by jointly considering the discrepancy of cores in different NUMA nodes and carefully allocating shared resources such as last level cache and memory bandwidth. We first propose a mathematical formulation, to optimally choose a node to place each SFC and allocate required shared system resources, in the form of a non-linear integer programming (NLIP) problem. Then we develop NUMASFP, a NUMA-aware dynamic SFC placement mechanism that places SFCs inside a server and migrates SFCs among NUMA nodes based on their current traffic rates to maximize the aggregate throughput of all SFCs. Furthermore, it ensures performance isolation for SFCs that are running inside the server. We evaluate the performance of NUMASFP by implementing it on a prototype system and also conducting large-scale simulation studies. The performance results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can effectively handle SFCs over state-of-the-art and baseline approaches.",
