            "abstract": "Evaluating different training interventions to determine which produce the best learning outcomes is one of the main challenges faced by instructional designers. Typically, these designers use A/B experiments to evaluate each intervention; however, it is costly and time consuming to run such studies. To address this issue, we explore how computational models of learning might support designers in reasoning causally about alternative interventions within a fractions tutor. We present an approach for automatically tuning models to specific individuals and show that personalized models make better predictions of students' behavior than generic ones. Next, we conduct simulations to generate counterfactual predictions of performance and learning for two students (high and low performing) in different versions of the fractions tutor. Our approach makes predictions that align with previous human findings, as well as testable predictions that might be evaluated with future human experiments.",

The learned tasks are represented as hierarchical decompositions of predicate-argument structures with scoped variable arguments. By using a GPT model to convert interactive dialog into a semantic representation, and then recursively asking for definitions of unknown steps, we show that hierarchical task knowledge can be acquired and re-used in a natural and unrestrained conversational environment. We compare our system to a similar architecture using a more conventional parser and show that our system tolerates a much wider variety of linguistic variance.",

One of the barriers to addressing this challenge is a lack of shared task domains in which to do basic research to study Human-Machine Teaming strategies. In our work, we employ speculative game design to create asymmetric cooperative games that can serve as test beds to study human-machine teaming challenges. In this paper, we will describe our general approach and detail the current state of our development efforts.",

However, little research has explored the possibility of applying such algorithms for educational purposes, such as teaching people to play strategy games. To investigate this gap, we designed and developed a Gomoku tutor that can provide instant/delayed feedback to users. We trained an expert model for Gomoku from scratch by using an open-source AlphaZero implementation and embedded this model into our Gomoku tutoring system. We plan to use this tutor to investigate two main research questions: 1) Can Game AI models, which are inhuman in their expertise, provide guidance that improves human learning? 2) How do different types of Game AI derived feedback affect people's learning outcomes? In this paper, we outline our experimental plans to investigate these questions.",

This work integrates the idea of convolutional image processing, from computer vision research, with a concept formation approach that is based on psychological studies of how humans incrementally form and use concepts.

We compare its performance to Cobweb, a concept formation approach that does not support convolutional processing, as well as two convolutional neural networks that vary in the complexity of their convolutional processing.

            "abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis for medical imaging is a well-studied field that aims to provide real-time decision support systems for physicians. These systems attempt to detect and diagnose a plethora of medical conditions across a variety of image diagnostic technologies including ultrasound, x-ray, MRI, and CT. When designing AI models for these systems, we are often limited by little training data, and for rare medical conditions, positive examples are difficult to obtain. These issues often cause models to perform poorly, so we needed a way to design an AI model in light of these limitations. Thus, our approach was to incorporate expert domain knowledge into the design of an AI model. We conducted two qualitative think-aloud studies with doctors trained in the interpretation of lung ultrasound diagnosis to extract relevant domain knowledge for the condition Pneumothorax. We extracted knowledge of key features and procedures used to make a diagnosis. With this knowledge, we employed knowledge engineering concepts to make recommendations for an AI model design to automatically diagnose Pneumothorax.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to the acquisition of language models from corpora. The framework builds on Cobweb, an early system for constructing taxonomic hierarchies of probabilistic concepts that used a tabular, attribute-value encoding of training cases and concepts, making it unsuitable for sequential input like language. In response, we explore three new extensions to Cobweb -- the Word, Leaf, and Path variants. These systems encode each training case as an anchor word and surrounding context words, and they store probabilistic descriptions of concepts as distributions over anchor and context information. As in the original Cobweb, a performance element sorts a new instance downward through the hierarchy and uses the final node to predict missing features. Learning is interleaved with performance, updating concept probabilities and hierarchy structure as classification occurs. Thus, the new approaches process training cases in an incremental, online manner that it very different from most methods for statistical language learning. We examine how well the three variants place synonyms together and keep homonyms apart, their ability to recall synonyms as a function of training set size, and their training efficiency. Finally, we discuss related work on incremental learning and directions for further research.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge tracing algorithms are embedded in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to keep track of students\u2019 learning process. While knowledge tracing models have been extensively studied in o\ufb04ine settings, very little work has explored their use in online settings. This is primarily because conducting experiments to evaluate and select knowledge tracing models in classroom settings is expensive. To \ufb01ll this gap, we introduce a novel way of using machine-learning models to generate simulated students. We conduct experiments using agents generated by the Apprentice Learner Architecture to investigate the online use of di\ufb00er-ent knowledge tracing models (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, the Streak model, and Deep Knowledge Tracing). An analysis of our simulation results revealed an error in the initial implementation of our Bayesian knowledge tracing model that was not identi\ufb01ed in our previous work. Our simulations also revealed a more fundamental limitation of Deep Knowledge Tracing that prevents the model from supporting mastery learning on multi-step problems. Together, these two \ufb01ndings suggest that Apprentice agents provide a practical means of evaluating knowledge tracing models prior to more costly classroom testing. Lastly, our analysis identi-\ufb01es a positive correlation between the Bayesian knowledge tracing parameters estimated from human data and the parameters estimated from simulated learners. This suggests that model parameters might be initialized using simulated data when no human-student data is yet available.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning have made it possible to train artificially intelligent agents that perform with super-human accuracy on a great diversity of complex tasks. However, the process of training these capabilities often necessitates millions of annotated examples -- far more than humans typically need in order to achieve a passing level of mastery on similar tasks. Thus, while contemporary methods in machine learning can produce agents that exhibit super-human performance, their rate of learning per opportunity in many domains is decidedly lower than human-learning. In this work we formalize a theory of Decomposed Inductive Procedure Learning (DIPL) that outlines how different forms of inductive symbolic learning can be used in combination to build agents that learn educationally relevant tasks such as mathematical, and scientific procedures, at a rate similar to human learners. We motivate the construction of this theory along Marr's concepts of the computational, algorithmic, and implementation levels of cognitive modeling, and outline at the computational-level six learning capacities that must be achieved to accurately model human learning. We demonstrate that agents built along the DIPL theory are amenable to satisfying these capacities, and demonstrate, both empirically and theoretically, that DIPL enables the creation of agents that exhibit human-like learning performance.",
