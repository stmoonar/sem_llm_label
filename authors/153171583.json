            "abstract": "As an excellent means of improving students' effective learning, knowledge tracking can assess the level of knowledge mastery and discover latent learning patterns based on students' historical learning evaluation of related questions. The advantage of knowledge tracking is that it can better organize and adjust students' learning plans, provide personalized guidance, and thus, achieve the purpose of artificial intelligence-assisted education. However, existing methods, for instance, convolutional knowledge tracing, lacking consideration of graph structure and multivariate time-series prediction, result in poor prediction accuracy. Inspired by recent successes of the graph neural network (GNN), we present a novel multivariate graph knowledge tracking (MVGKT) framework to address these limitations. Specifically, a multivariate time-series knowledge tracking system based on spatio-temporal GNN is designed to model student learning trajectories in different spatial and temporal dimensions and capture both temporal dependencies and interstudent correlations. MVGKT incorporates a gate recurrent unit attentive mechanism and graph Fourier transform, discrete Fourier transform, and graph convolution network to increase the predictive accuracy of the student performances. In addition, we design a question difficulty extraction system to obtain information on the difficulty of the questions, and thus, enhance the data features. Numerous experiments on the ASSISTments dataset have demonstrated that MVGKT is superior to existing knowledge-tracking methods on four metrics and has shown that our approach can enhance the predictive accuracy of student performance.",

            "title": "Towards Flexible and Adaptive Neural Process for Cold-Start Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems have been widely adopted in various online personal e-commerce applications for improving user experience. A long-standing challenge in recommender systems is how to provide accurate recommendation to users in cold-start situations where only a few user-item interactions can be observed. Recently, meta learning methods provide a promising solution, and most of them follow a way of parameter initialization where predictions can be fast adapted via multiple gradient descent steps. While these meta-learning recommenders promote model performance, how to derive a fundamental paradigm that enables both flexible approximations of complex user interaction distributions and effective task adaptations of global knowledge still remains a critical yet under-explored problem. To this end, we present the Flow-based Adaptive Neural Process (FANP), a new probabilistic meta-learning model where estimating the preference of each user is governed by an underlying stochastic process. Following an encoder-decoder generative framework, FANP is an effective few-shot function estimator that directly maps limited user interactions to a predictive distribution without complicated gradient updates. Through introducing a conditional normalization flow-based encoder, FANP can get rid of the model bias on latent variables and thereby derive more flexible variational distributions. Meanwhile, we propose a task-adaptive mechanism capturing the relevance of different tasks for improving adaptation ability of global knowledge. The learned task-specific and task-relevant representations are simultaneously exploited to generate the decoder parameters via a novel modulation-augmented hypernetwork. FANP is evaluated on both scenario-specific and user-specific cold-start recommendations on various real-world datasets. Extensive experimental results and detailed model analyses demonstrate that our model yields superior performance compared with multiple state-of-the-art meta-learning recommenders.",

            "abstract": "Social Internet of Things (SIoT), a promising and emerging paradigm that injects the notion of social networking into smart objects (i.e., things), paving the way for the next generation of Internet of Things. However, due to the risks and uncertainty, a crucial and urgent problem to be settled is establishing reliable relationships within SIoT, that is, trust evaluation. Graph neural networks for trust evaluation typically adopt a straightforward way such as one-hot or node2vec to comprehend node characteristics, which ignores the valuable semantic knowledge attached to nodes. Moreover, the underlying structure of SIoT is usually complex, including both the heterogeneous graph structure and pairwise trust relationships, which renders hard to preserve the properties of SIoT trust during information propagation. To address these aforementioned problems, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced graph neural network (KGTrust) for better trust evaluation in SIoT. Specifically, we first extract useful knowledge from users\u2019 comment behaviors and external structured triples related to object descriptions, in order to gain a deeper insight into the semantics of users and objects. Furthermore, we introduce a discriminative convolutional layer that utilizes heterogeneous graph structure, node semantics, and augmented trust relationships to learn node embeddings from the perspective of a user as a trustor or a trustee, effectively capturing multi-aspect properties of SIoT trust during information propagation. Finally, a trust prediction layer is developed to estimate the trust relationships between pairwise nodes. Extensive experiments on three public datasets illustrate the superior performance of KGTrust over state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Wireless techniques are playing an increasingly important role in the Industrial Internet of Things. However, the dependability of wireless communication systems is challenged facing high requirements for industrial applications. Dependability assessment models especially supported by machine learning somehow ease the issue, while a cross-level model for distributed wireless devices is lacking. Therefore, this paper proposes a cross-level dependability assessment model with a distributed split mechanism. The model includes device-level assessment sub-models and a system-level assessment sub-model which are trained together but are split and deployed separately by the distributed split mechanism. We implemented this model on a realistic measurement dataset. Comparative experiments indicate that the proposed model not only completes cross-level assessment but also has better performance than past single-level assessment models. Further, experiments on execution time show that the model based on the distributed split mechanism is faster than a centralized mechanism because the split sub-models can process data locally.",

            "abstract": "Current research on online public opinion regarding the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) leverages keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to analyze online public opinion. The multi-granularity features of online public opinions and semantic relations between the features, how-ever, remain less explored. Reliance on only topics or keywords for measuring public opinion is insufficient as topics are too broad and keywords too narrow. Analysis at an intermediate level, which most studies overlook, is crucial in gaining a clearer insight into public opinion. Additionally, exploring the semantic relationships between components of online public opinion can shed light on the logical connections between them and help understand how they interact in the dissemination of online public opinion, leading to a better understanding of its evolution mechanism. We conducted a public opinion analysis on Worldwide COVID-19 outbreaks via Topic Knowledge Graph. Specifically, we first use the Combined Topic Model to extract public opinion topics. Then multi-dimensions attributes of the topic such as [subject, predicate, object] triples, topic popularity, and topic emotion intensity are extracted. Subsequently, the semantic relations of different public opinion topics are calculated from the two levels of predicates co-occurrence and subject-object sharing. Finally, we applied the constructed framework to the public opinion information related to COVID-19 and analyzed the characteristics in the evolution of online public opinion.",

            "abstract": "Long sequence time-series forecasting has important applications in long-term planning management scenarios. Researches based on Transformer effectively improve the capability for long sequence forecasting, but the quadratic computing complexity causes high resource consumption, limiting its application in long sequence scenarios. Meanwhile, many studies use the dot-product attention mechanism to model time dependency, but don't model the sequential information of time-series. It prevents the capture of more efficient long-term time dependencies. In addition, in the latest researches combining decomposition methods, there are the problem of trend information loss and the limitation of not being able to peel off more subdivided time patterns, which restrict the improvement of prediction ability. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based model, Segformer. Firstly, Segformer extracts multiple components with obvious dependencies and coordinates the modeling process with the help of multi-component decomposition blocks and collaboration blocks. Secondly, SegAttention, a new variant of the attention mechanism with $O((\\frac{L}{l})^{2})$ computation complexity (whole sequence length L, segment length $l$), is proposed to model the dependencies between segments according to the values and orders in the segment sequences, and aggregate segment-level information. Experiments on five real datasets show that Segformer respectively reduces the forecasting error by about 13% and 22% compared with the two advanced benchmarks, and Segformer offers an efficient solution for long-term dependency modeling problem of time-series.",

Here we propose DSCPCD\u2014a dual structural consistency preserving community detection method to uncover the hidden community structure, which is designed regarding two criteria: 1) users interact with each other in a manner combining uncertainty and certainty; 2) original explicit network (two linked users are friends) and potential implicit network (two linked users have common friends) should have a consistent community structure, i.e., dual structural consistency. Particularly, DSCPCD formulates each user in a social network as an individual in an evolutionary game associated with community-aware payoff settings, where the community state evolves under the guidance of replicator dynamics. To further seek each user's membership, we develop a happiness index to measure all users\u2019 satisfaction towards two community structures in explicit and implicit networks, meanwhile, the dual community structural consistency between the two networks is also characterized. Specifically, each user is assumed to maximize the happiness bounded by the evolutionary community state. We evaluate DSCPCD on several real-world and synthetic datasets, and the results show that it can yield substantial performance gains in terms of detection accuracy over several baselines.",

            "title": "A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Summarization With Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "As large-scale graphs become more widespread, more and more computational challenges with extracting, processing, and interpreting large graph data are being exposed. It is therefore natural to search for ways to summarize these expansive graphs while preserving their key characteristics. In the past, most graph summarization techniques sought to capture the most important part of a graph statistically. However, today, the high dimensionality and complexity of modern graph data are making deep learning techniques more popular. Hence, this article presents a comprehensive survey of progress in deep learning summarization techniques that rely on graph neural networks (GNNs). Our investigation includes a review of the current state-of-the-art approaches, including recurrent GNNs, convolutional GNNs, graph autoencoders, and graph attention networks. A new burgeoning line of research is also discussed where graph reinforcement learning is being used to evaluate and improve the quality of graph summaries. Additionally, the survey provides details of benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and open-source tools that are often employed in experimentation settings, along with a detailed comparison, discussion, and takeaways for the research community focused on graph summarization. Finally, the survey concludes with a number of open research challenges to motivate further study in this area.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful models to handle graph data and can achieve state-of-the-art in many critical tasks including node classification and link prediction. However, existing graph neural networks still face both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing based on previous literature. To this end, we propose a new Curvature-based topology-aware Dropout sampling technique named CurvDrop, in which we integrate the Discrete Ricci Curvature into graph neural networks to enable more expressive graph models. Also, this work can improve graph neural networks by quantifying connections in graphs and using structural information such as community structures in graphs. As a result, our method can tackle the both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing with theoretical justification. Also, numerous experiments on public datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. The code and data are released in https://github.com/liu-yang-maker/Curvature-based-Dropout.",
