            "abstract": "This paper presents the research findings resulting from experiments conducted as part of the Check-That! Lab Task 1B-English submission at CLEF 2023. The aim of the research was to evaluate the check-worthiness of short texts in English. Various methodologies were employed, including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning techniques, and different GPT and BERT models were assessed. Given the significant increase in the use of GPT models in recent times, we posed a research question to investigate whether GPT models exhibit notable superiority over BERT models in detecting check-worthy claims. Our findings indicate that fine-tuned BERT models can perform comparably to large language models such as GPT-3 in identifying check-worthy claims for this particular task.",

            "abstract": "There are over a billion websites on the Internet that can potentially serve as sources of information on various topics. One of the most popular examples of such an online source is Wikipedia. This public knowledge base is co-edited by millions of users from all over the world. Information in each language version of Wikipedia can be created and edited independently. Therefore, we can observe certain inconsistencies in the statements and facts described therein - depending on language and topic. In accordance with the Wikipedia content authoring guidelines, information in Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published sources. So, based on data from such a collaboratively edited encyclopedia, we should also be able to find important sources on specific topics. This effect can be potentially useful for people and organizations. The reliability of a source in Wikipedia articles depends on the context. So the same source (website) may have various degrees of reliability in Wikipedia depending on topic and language version. Moreover, reliability of the same source can change over the time. The purpose of this study is to identify reliable sources on a specific topic - the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an analysis was carried out on real data from Wikipedia within selected language versions and within a selected time period.",

            "abstract": "For over 21 years Wikipedia has been edited by volunteers from all over the world. Such editors have different education, cultural background and competences. One of the core rules of Wikipedia says, that information in its articles should be based on reliable sources and Wikipedia readers must be able to verify particular facts in text. However, reliability is a subjective concept and a reputation of the same source can be assessed differently depending on a person (or group of persons), language and topic. So each language version of Wikipedia may have own rules or criteria on how the website must be assessed before it can be used as a source in references. At the same time, nowadays there are over 1 billion websites on the Internet and only few developed Wikipedia language versions contain non-exhaustive lists of popular websites with reliability assessment. Additionally, since reputation of the source can be changed during the time, such lists must be updated regularly.This study presents the result of identification of reliable sources of information based on the analysis of over 200 million references that were extracted from over 40 million Wikipedia articles. Using DBpedia and Wikidata we identified articles related to various kinds of companies and found the most important sources of information in this area. This also allows to compare differences of the source reliability between Wikipedia languages.",

This data is mostly massive streams of high velocity, magnitude, and heterogeneity, which represent a flow of goods, shipments and the movements of fleet. It is therefore necessary to develop a scalable framework and apply tools capable of handling these streams. In the paper we propose an approach for the selection of software for stream processing solutions that may be used in the transportation domain. We provide an overview of potential stream processing technologies, followed by the method for choosing the selected software for real-time analysis of data streams coming from objects in motion. We have selected two solutions: Apache Spark Streaming and Apache Flink, and benchmarked them on a real-world task. We identified the caveats and challenges when it comes to implementation of the solution in practice.",

            "abstract": "One of the most important factors impacting quality of content in Wikipedia is presence of reliable sources. By following references, readers can verify facts or find more details about described topic. A Wikipedia article can be edited independently in any of over 300 languages, even by anonymous users, therefore information about the same topic may be inconsistent. This also applies to use of references in different language versions of a particular article, so the same statement can have different sources. In this paper we analyzed over 40 million articles from the 55 most developed language versions of Wikipedia to extract information about over 200 million references and find the most popular and reliable sources. We presented 10 models for the assessment of the popularity and reliability of the sources based on analysis of meta information about the references in Wikipedia articles, page views and authors of the articles. Using DBpedia and Wikidata we automatically identified the alignment of the sources to a specific domain. Additionally, we analyzed the changes of popularity and reliability in time and identified growth leaders in each of the considered months. The results can be used for quality improvements of the content in different languages versions of Wikipedia.",

Therefore, the quality of information about the same topic depends on the language. Any interested user can improve an article and that improvement may depend on the popularity of the article. The goal of this study is to show what topics are best represented in different language versions of Wikipedia using results of quality assessment for over 39 million articles in 55 languages. In this paper, we also analyze how popular selected topics are among readers and authors in various languages. We used two approaches to assign articles to various topics. First, we selected 27 main multilingual categories and analyzed all their connections with sub-categories based on information extracted from over 10 million categories in 55 language versions. To classify the articles to one of the 27 main categories, we took into account over 400 million links from articles to over 10 million categories and over 26 million links between categories. In the second approach, we used data from DBpedia and Wikidata. We also showed how the results of the study can be used to build local and global rankings of the Wikipedia content.",

            "abstract": "Despite the fact that Wikipedia is often criticized for its poor quality, it continues to be one of the most popular knowledge bases in the world. Articles in this free encyclopedia on various topics can be created and edited in about 300 different language versions independently. Our research has showed that in language sensitive topics, the quality of information can be relatively better in the relevant language versions. However, in most cases, it is difficult for the Wikipedia readers to determine the language affiliation of the described subject. Additionally, each language edition of Wikipedia can have own rules in the manual assessing of the content\u2019s quality. There are also differences in grading schemes between language versions: some use a 6\u20138 grade system to assess articles, and some are limited to 2\u20133. This makes automatic quality comparison of articles between various languages a challenging task, particularly if we take into account a large number of unassessed articles; some of the Wikipedia language editions have over 99% of articles without a quality grade. The paper presents the results of a relative quality and popularity assessment of over 28 million articles in 44 selected language versions. Comparative analysis of the quality and the popularity of articles in popular topics was also conducted. Additionally, the correlation between quality and popularity of Wikipedia articles of selected topics in various languages was investigated. The proposed method allows us to find articles with information of better quality that can be used to automatically enrich other language editions of Wikipedia.",
