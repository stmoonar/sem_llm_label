            "abstract": "Multi-sourced networks naturally appear in many application domains, ranging from bioinformatics, social networks, neuroscience to management. Although state-of-the-art offers rich models and algorithms to find various patterns when input networks are given, it has largely remained nascent on how vulnerable the mining results are due to the adversarial attacks. In this paper, we address the problem of attacking multi-network mining through the way of deliberately perturbing the networks to alter the mining results. The key idea of the proposed method (<sc>Admiring</sc>) is effective and efficient influence functions on the Sylvester equation defined over the input networks, which plays a central and unifying role in various multi-network mining tasks.

            "abstract": "The advances in deep learning have enabled machine learning methods to outperform human beings in various areas, but it remains a great challenge for a well-trained model to quickly adapt to a new task. One promising solution to realize this goal is through meta-learning, also known as learning to learn, which has achieved promising results in few-shot learning. However, current approaches are still enormously different from human beings' learning process, especially in the ability to extract structural and transferable knowledge. This drawback makes current meta-learning frameworks non-interpretable and hard to extend to more complex tasks. We tackle this problem by introducing concept discovery to the few-shot learning problem, where we achieve more effective adaptation by meta-learning the structure among the data features, leading to a composite representation of the data. Our proposed method Concept-Based Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (COMAML) has been shown to achieve consistent improvements in the structured data for both synthesized datasets and real-world datasets.",

To address this issue, existing efforts have mainly been dedicated to improving the robustness of GNNs, while little attention has been paid to the detection of such attacks. In this work, we study the victim node detection problem under topology attacks against GNNs. Our approach is built upon the key observation rooted in the intrinsic message passing nature of GNNs. That is, the neighborhood of a victim node tends to have two competing group forces, pushing the node classification results towards the original label and the targeted label, respectively. Based on this observation, we propose to detect victim nodes by deliberately designing an effective measurement of the neighborhood variance for each node. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets and five existing topology attacks show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed detection approach.",

            "abstract": "Neural graph collaborative filtering has received great recent attention due to its power of encoding the high-order neighborhood via the backbone graph neural networks. However, their robustness against noisy user-item interactions remains largely unexplored. Existing work on robust collaborative filtering mainly improves the robustness by denoising the graph structure, while recent progress in other fields has shown that directly adding adversarial perturbations in the embedding space can significantly improve the model robustness. In this work, we propose to improve the robustness of neural graph collaborative filtering via both denoising in the structure space and perturbing in the embedding space. Specifically, in the structure space, we measure the reliability of interactions and further use it to affect the message propagation process of the backbone graph neural networks; in the embedding space, we add in-distribution perturbations by mimicking the behavior of adversarial attacks and further combine it with contrastive learning to improve the performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the recent neural graph collaborative filtering methods especially when there are injected noisy interactions in the training data.",

            "abstract": "Contrastive learning is an effective unsupervised method in graph representation learning. Recently, the data augmentation based contrastive learning method has been extended from images to graphs. However, most prior works are directly adapted from the models designed for images. Unlike the data augmentation on images, the data augmentation on graphs is far less intuitive and much harder to provide high-quality contrastive samples, which are the key to the performance of contrastive learning models. This leaves much space for improvement over the existing graph contrastive learning frameworks. In this work, by introducing an adversarial graph view and an information regularizer, we propose a simple but effective method, Adversarial Graph Contrastive Learning (ArieL), to extract informative contrastive samples within a reasonable constraint. It consistently outperforms the current graph contrastive learning methods in the node classification task over various real-world datasets and further improves the robustness of graph contrastive learning.",

            "abstract": "It is crucial to model missing ratings in recommender systems since user preferences learnt from only observed ratings are biased. One possible explanation for missing ratings is motivated by the spiral of silence theory. When the majority opinion is formed, a spiral process is triggered where users are more and more likely to show their ratings if they perceive that they are supported by the opinion climate. In this paper we first verify the existence of the spiral process in recommender systems by using a variety of different real-life datasets. We then study the characteristics of two key factors in the spiral process: opinion climate and the hardcore users who will give ratings even when they are minority opinion holders. Based on our empirical findings, we develop four variants to model missing ratings. They mimic different components of the spiral of silence based on the spiral process with global opinion climate, local opinion climate, hardcore users, relationships between hardcore users and items, respectively. We experimentally show that, the presented variants all outperform state-of-the-art recommendation models with missing rating components.",

In this paper, we propose a bi-level optimization approach for learning the optimal graph structure via directly learning the Personalized PageRank propagation matrix as well as the downstream semi-supervised node classification simultaneously. We also explore a low-rank approximation model for further reducing the time complexity.

            "abstract": "Bipartite graphs are powerful data structures to model interactions between two types of nodes, which have been used in a variety of applications, such as recommender systems, information retrieval, and drug discovery. A fundamental challenge for bipartite graphs is how to learn informative node embeddings. Despite the success of recent self-supervised learning methods on bipartite graphs, their objectives are discriminating instance-wise positive and negative node pairs, which could contain cluster-level errors. In this paper, we introduce a novel co-cluster infomax (COIN) framework, which captures the cluster-level information by maximizing the mutual information of co-clusters. Different from previous infomax methods which estimate mutual information by neural networks, COIN could easily calculate mutual information. Besides, COIN is an end-to-end coclustering method which can be trained jointly with other objective functions and optimized via back-propagation. Furthermore, we also provide theoretical analysis for COIN. We theoretically prove that COIN is able to effectively maximize the mutual information of node embeddings and COIN is upper-bounded by the prior distributions of nodes. We extensively evaluate the proposed COIN framework on various benchmark datasets and tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of COIN.",

Despite the successes of GCN deployment, GCN often exhibits performance disparity with respect to node degrees, resulting in worse predictive accuracy for low-degree nodes. We formulate the problem of mitigating the degree-related performance disparity in GCN from the perspective of the Rawlsian difference principle, which is originated from the theory of distributive justice. Mathematically, we aim to balance the utility between low-degree nodes and high-degree nodes while minimizing the task-specific loss. Specifically, we reveal the root cause of this degree-related unfairness by analyzing the gradients of weight matrices in GCN. Guided by the gradients of weight matrices, we further propose a pre-processing method RawlsGCN-Graph and an in-processing method RawlsGCN-Grad that achieves fair predictive accuracy in low-degree nodes without modification on the GCN architecture or introduction of additional parameters. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RawlsGCN methods in significantly reducing degree-related bias while retaining comparable overall performance.",

Performance-oriented GNNs have exhibited potential adverse effects, such as vulnerability to adversarial attacks, unexplainable discrimination against disadvantaged groups, or excessive resource consumption in edge computing environments. To avoid these unintentional harms, it is necessary to build competent GNNs characterized by trustworthiness. To this end, we propose a comprehensive roadmap to build trustworthy GNNs from the view of the various computing technologies involved. In this survey, we introduce basic concepts and comprehensively summarize existing efforts for trustworthy GNNs from six aspects, including robustness, explainability, privacy, fairness, accountability, and environmental well-being.
