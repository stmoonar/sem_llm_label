            "abstract": "Telecommunications systems management represents a technical challenge with profound economic implications. Many different sources of information must be integrated, and complex decisions must be automatically taken and executed. In this article, we review the usage of knowledge graphs in this domain since they are a powerful tool for dealing with data integration and complex knowledge representation. The main insights are that they have been applied in several areas of telecommunications management, such as resource/service discovery and monitoring, with a particular focus on software-defined networks. Their main advantages are their extensibility and interoperability. However, data quality and graph performance are still challenges, and work is yet to be done for its application to the rest of the telecommunication management areas.",

            "abstract": "Generating high-quality annotations for object detection and recognition is a challenging and important task, especially in relation to safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving (AD). Due to the difficulty of perception in challenging situations such as occlusion, degraded weather, and sensor failure, objects can go unobserved and unlabeled. In this paper, we present CLUE-AD, a general-purpose method for detecting and labeling unobserved entities by leveraging the object continuity assumption within the context of a scene. This method is dataset-agnostic, supporting any existing and future AD datasets. Using a real-world dataset representing complex urban driving scenes, we demonstrate the applicability of CLUE-AD for detecting unobserved entities and augmenting the scene data with new labels.",

            "abstract": "Rare event prediction involves identifying and forecasting events with a low probability using machine learning (ML) and data analysis. Due to the imbalanced data distributions, where the frequency of common events vastly outweighs that of rare events, it requires using specialized methods within each step of the ML pipeline, i.e., from data processing to algorithms to evaluation protocols. Predicting the occurrences of rare events is important for real-world applications, such as Industry 4.0, and is an active research area in statistical and ML. This paper comprehensively reviews the current approaches for rare event prediction along four dimensions: rare event data, data processing, algorithmic approaches, and evaluation approaches. Specifically, we consider 73 datasets from different modalities (i.e., numerical, image, text, and audio), four major categories of data processing, five major algorithmic groupings, and two broader evaluation approaches. This paper aims to identify gaps in the current literature and highlight the challenges of predicting rare events. It also suggests potential research directions, which can help guide practitioners and researchers.",

The breadth and complexity of significant challenges required to provide adequate care involve:\n(a) Personalized patient understanding, (b) Safety-constrained and medically validated chatbot patient interactions, and (c) Support for continued feedback-based refinements in design using chatbot-patient interactions. \nWe propose Alleviate, a chatbot designed to assist patients suffering from mental health challenges with personalized care and assist clinicians with understanding their patients better. Alleviate draws from an array of publicly available clinically valid mental-health texts and databases, allowing Alleviate to make medically sound and informed decisions. In addition, Alleviate's modular design and explainable decision-making lends itself to robust and continued feedback-based refinements to its design. In this paper, we explain the different modules of Alleviate and submit a short video demonstrating Alleviate's capabilities to help patients and clinicians understand each other better to facilitate optimal care strategies.",

Memes have become a powerful tool for expressing emotions and sentiments, possibly even spreading hate and misinformation, through humor and sarcasm. In this paper, we present the overview of the Memotion 3 shared task, as part of the DeFactify 2 workshop at AAAI-23. The task released an annotated dataset of Hindi-English code-mixed memes based on their Sentiment (Task A), Emotion (Task B), and Emotion intensity (Task C). Each of these is defined as an individual task and the participants are ranked separately for each task. Over 50 teams registered for the shared task and 5 made final submissions to the test set of the Memotion 3 dataset. CLIP, BERT modifications, ViT etc. were the most popular models among the participants along with approaches such as Student-Teacher model, Fusion, and Ensembling. The best final F1 score for Task A is 34.41, Task B is 79.77 and Task C is 59.82.",

This approach addresses a key criticism of current generation systems, namely, their inability to generate human-understandable explanations for their outcomes and ensure safe behaviors, especially in scenarios with unknown unknowns (e.g., cybersecurity, privacy). The integration of neural networks, which excel at exploring complex data spaces, and symbolic KGs, which represent domain knowledge, allows AI systems to reason, learn, and generalize in a manner understandable to experts.

            "abstract": "Over the past two decades, dialogue modeling has made significant strides, moving from simple rule-based responses to personalized and persuasive response generation. However, despite these advancements, the objective functions and evaluation metrics for dialogue generation have remained stagnant. These lexical-based metrics, e.g., cross-entropy and BLEU, have two key limitations: (a) word-to-word matching without semantic consideration: It assigns the same credit for failure to generate\"nice\"and\"rice\"for\"good\", (b) missing context attribute for evaluating the generated response: Even if a generated response is relevant to the ongoing dialogue context, it may still be penalized for not matching the gold utterance provided in the corpus. In this paper, we first investigate these limitations comprehensively and propose a new loss function called Semantic Infused Contextualized diaLogue (SemTextualLogue) loss function. We also formulate an evaluation metric called Dialuation, incorporating both context and semantic relevance. We experimented with both non-pretrained and pre-trained models on two dialogue corpora, encompassing task-oriented and open-domain scenarios. We found that the dialogue generation models trained with SemTextualLogueloss attained superior performance compared to the traditional cross-entropy loss function. The findings establish that the effective training of a dialogue generation model hinges significantly on incorporating semantics and context. This pattern is also mirrored in the introduced Dialuation metric, where the consideration of both context and semantics correlates more strongly with human evaluation compared to traditional metrics.",

            "abstract": "The next phase of manufacturing is centered on making the switch from traditional automated to autonomous systems. Future factories are required to be agile, allowing for more customized production and resistance to disturbances. Such production lines would be able to reallocate resources as needed and minimize downtime while keeping up with market demands. These systems must be capable of complex decision-making based on parameters, such as machine status, sensory/IoT data, and inspection results. Current manufacturing lines lack this complex capability and instead focus on low-level decision-making on the machine level without utilizing the generated data to its full extent. This article presents progress toward this autonomy by introducing Semantic Web capabilities applied to managing the production line. Finally, a full autonomous manufacturing use case is also developed to showcase the value of Semantic Web in a manufacturing context. This use case utilizes diverse data sources and domain knowledge to complete a manufacturing process despite malfunctioning equipment. It highlights the benefit of Semantic Web in manufacturing by integrating the heterogeneous information required for the process to be completed. This provides an approach to autonomous manufacturing not yet fully realized at the intersection of Semantic Web and manufacturing.",

            "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced, they have brought forth new challenges, with one of the prominent issues being LLM hallucination. While various mitigation techniques are emerging to address hallucination, it is equally crucial to delve into its underlying causes. Consequently, in this preliminary exploratory investigation, we examine how linguistic factors in prompts, specifically readability, formality, and concreteness, influence the occurrence of hallucinations. Our experimental results suggest that prompts characterized by greater formality and concreteness tend to result in reduced hallucination. However, the outcomes pertaining to readability are somewhat inconclusive, showing a mixed pattern.",
