            "title": "Partisan US News Media Representations of Syrian Refugees",
            "abstract": "We investigate how representations of Syrian refugees (2011-2021) differ across US partisan news outlets. We analyze 47,388 articles from the online US media about Syrian refugees to detail differences in reporting between left- and right-leaning media. We use various NLP techniques to understand these differences. Our polarization and question answering results indicated that left-leaning media tended to represent refugees as child victims, welcome in the US, and right-leaning media cast refugees as Islamic terrorists. We noted similar results with our sentiment and offensive speech scores over time, which detail possibly unfavorable representations of refugees in right-leaning media. A strength of our work is how the different techniques we have applied validate each other. Based on our results, we provide several recommendations. Stakeholders may utilize our findings to intervene around refugee representations, and design communications campaigns that improve the way society sees refugees and possibly aid refugee outcomes.",

            "abstract": "This paper reviews the current evidence base regarding the use of urban design principles in refugee camps to exploit the built environment for improved health outcomes. A systematic literature review was conducted to gather and analyze existing knowledge given the dearth of refugee camps that currently employ this theoretical framework. This study focuses on associating refugee camp design and organization with three areas of refugee health including resilience, mental health, and physical health. This study then uses a preliminary case study of the Azraq Refugee Camp in Jordan to present the expected theoretical findings within the structure of the only nonstandard refugee camp in existence. In total, 34 studies were reviewed and their main findings were presented. The results should be interpreted with caution due to the considerable limitations in the existing evidence base; however, they represent important considerations for overcoming the deficiencies of the current standard refugee camp design.",
