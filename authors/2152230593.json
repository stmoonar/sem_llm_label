            "title": "Partial Adaptive Indexing for Approximate Query Answering",
            "abstract": "In data exploration, users need to analyze large data files quickly, aiming to minimize data-to-analysis time. While recent adaptive indexing approaches address this need, they are cases where demonstrate poor performance. Particularly, during the initial queries, in regions with a high density of objects, and in very large files over commodity hardware. This work introduces an approach for adaptive indexing driven by both query workload and user-defined accuracy constraints to support approximate query answering. The approach is based on partial index adaptation which reduces the costs associated with reading data files and refining indexes. We leverage a hierarchical tile-based indexing scheme and its stored metadata to provide efficient query evaluation, ensuring accuracy within user-specified bounds. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates improvement on query evaluation time, especially during initial user exploration.",

            "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges in interactive visual exploration of large multi-variate time series data. Traditional data reduction techniques may improve latency but can distort visualizations. State-of-the-art methods aimed at 100% accurate visualization often fail to maintain interactive response times or require excessive preprocessing and additional storage. We propose an in-memory adaptive caching approach, MinMaxCache, that efficiently reuses previous query results to accelerate visualization performance within accuracy constraints. MinMaxCache fetches data at adaptively determined aggregation granularities to maintain interactive response times and generate approximate visualizations with accuracy guarantees. Our results show that it is up to 10 times faster than current solutions without significant accuracy compromise.",

            "abstract": "With the lowering costs of sensors, high-volume and high-velocity data are increasingly being generated and analyzed, especially in IoT domains like energy and smart homes. Consequently, applications that require accurate short-term forecasts and predictions are also steadily increasing. In this paper, we provide an overview of a novel end-to-end platform that provides efficient ingestion, compression, transfer, query processing, and machine learning-based analytics for high-frequency and high-volume time series from IoT. The performance of the platform is evaluated using real-world dataset from RES installations. The results show the importance of high-frequency analytics and the surprisingly positive impact of error bounded lossy compression on machine learning in the form of AutoML. For example, when detecting yaw misalignments in wind turbines, an improvement of 9% in accuracy was observed for AutoML models on lossy compressed data compared to the current industry standard of 10-minute aggregated data. Thus, these small-scale experiments show the potential of the platform, and larger pilots are planned.",
