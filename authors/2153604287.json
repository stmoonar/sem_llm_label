            "title": "Cross-Domain Character Recognition through Latent Space Alignment",
            "abstract": "Deep neural networks have proved its capability in many machine learning tasks. The effectiveness of deep neural networks in real-world applications, however, is greatly affected by the distribution discrepancy between the training and testing data. To address the issue, domain adaptation methods have been studied. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method which combines the feature learning and the distribution estimation into one learning framework, enabling automatic update of feature representations through fine-tuning parameterized distributions. As such, our model can produce an unified distribution to represent both source and target samples. Furthermore, two new regularizers are integrated into the optimization objective to minimize the divergence of the unified distribution from those of source and target domains. Experiments on character reconstruction show that our method demonstrates much better learning ability compared to the existing variational autoencoder. More importantly, our method improves recognition accuracy by more than 5% from that of the state-of-the-art methods in domain adaptation tasks built upon popular character datasets.",

            "title": "A Knowledge Search Algorithm Based on Multidimensional Semantic Similarity Analysis in Knowledge Graph Systems of Power Grid Networks",
            "abstract": "In the face of intelligent demand for information search, knowledge search is now the most promising and has been widely used in the current knowledge graph research. However, the traditional search methods based on node label only are difficult to present the semantic relationships between multidimensional nodes due to that the structure information and information in other dimensions is neglected, thus resulting in low semantic relevance and search efficiency for query results. In this paper, in order to improve the semantic relevance and quality of search results, we propose a knowledge searching algorithm based on analysis of multidimensional semantic similarity for knowledge graph systems, which combines both the ontology information and multi-hop neighborhood information together during the search process. The algorithm is designed for a knowledge graph system developed by the State Grid Anhui power distribution network, China. Several experiments are performed and the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the recent knowledge searching methods.",
