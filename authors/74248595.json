            "abstract": "This work presents a longitudinal study of diversity among the Affective Computing research community members. We explore several dimensions of diversity, including gender, geography, institutional types of affiliations and selected combinations of dimensions. We cover the last 10 years of the IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing (TAFFC) journal and the International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), the primary sources of publications in Affective Computing. We also present an analysis of diversity among the members of the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC). Our findings reveal a \u201cleaky pipeline\u201d in the field, with a low \u2013albeit slowly increasing over the years\u2013 representation of women. They also show that academic institutions clearly dominate publications, ahead of industry and governmental centres. In terms of geography, most publications come from the USA, contributions from Latin America or Africa being almost non-existent. Lastly, we find that diversity in the characteristics of researchers (gender and geographic location) influences diversity in the topics. To conclude, we analyse initiatives that have been undertaken in other AI-related research communities to foster diversity, and recommend a set of initiatives that could be applied to the Affective Computing field to increase diversity in its different facets. The diversity data collected in this work are publicly available, ensuring strict personal data protection and governance rules.",

            "abstract": "The amount and dissemination rate of media content accessible online is nowadays overwhelming. Recommender Systems filter this information into manageable streams or feeds, adapted to our personal needs or preferences. It is of utter importance that algorithms employed to filter information do not distort or cut out important elements from our perspectives of the world. Under this principle, it is essential to involve diverse views and teams from the earliest stages of their design and development. This has been highlighted, for instance, in recent European Union regulations such as the Digital Services Act, via the requirement of risk monitoring, including the risk of discrimination, and the AI Act, through the requirement to involve people with diverse backgrounds in the development of AI systems. We look into the geographic diversity of the recommender systems research community, specifically by analyzing the affiliation countries of the authors who contributed to the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys) during the last 15 years. This study has been carried out in the framework of the Diversity in AI - DivinAI project, whose main objective is the long-term monitoring of diversity in AI forums through a set of indexes.",

            "abstract": "Among the seven key requirements to achieve trustworthy AI proposed by the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI-HLEG) established by the European Commission (EC), the fifth requirement (\"Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness\") declares:\"In order to achieve Trustworthy AI, we must enable inclusion and diversity throughout the entire AI system's life cycle. [...] This requirement is closely linked with the principle of fairness\". In this paper, we try to shed light on how closely these two distinct concepts, diversity and fairness, may be treated by focusing on information access systems and ranking literature. These concepts should not be used interchangeably because they do represent two different values, but what we argue is that they also cannot be considered totally unrelated or divergent. Having diversity does not imply fairness, but fostering diversity can effectively lead to fair outcomes, an intuition behind several methods proposed to mitigate the disparate impact of information access systems, i.e. recommender systems and search engines.",

By analyzing their explicit and implicit feedback, we show that exposure to specific levels of music recommendation diversity may be responsible for long-term impacts on listeners\u2019 attitudes. In particular, we highlight the function of diversity in increasing the openness in listening to EM, a music genre not particularly known or liked by the participants previous to their participation in the study. Moreover, we demonstrate that recommendations may help listeners in removing positive and negative attachments towards EM, deconstructing pre-existing implicit associations but also stereotypes associated with this music. In addition, our results show the significant influence that recommendation diversity has in generating curiosity in listeners.",

            "abstract": "Ranking, recommendation, and retrieval systems are widely used in online platforms and other societal systems, including e-commerce, media-streaming, admissions, gig platforms, and hiring. In the recent past, a large \u201cfair ranking\u201d research literature has been developed around making these systems fair to the individuals, providers, or content that are being ranked. Most of this literature defines fairness for a single instance of retrieval, or as a simple additive notion for multiple instances of retrievals over time. This work provides a critical overview of this literature, detailing the often context-specific concerns that such approaches miss: the gap between high ranking placements and true provider utility, spillovers and compounding effects over time, induced strategic incentives, and the effect of statistical uncertainty. We then provide a path forward for a more holistic and impact-oriented fair ranking research agenda, including methodological lessons from other fields and the role of the broader stakeholder community in overcoming data bottlenecks and designing effective regulatory environments.",

            "abstract": "Music listening in today\u2019s digital spaces is highly characterized by the availability of huge music catalogues, accessible by people all over the world. In this scenario, recommender systems are designed to guide listeners in finding tracks and artists that best fit their requests, having therefore the power to influence the diversity of the music they listen to. Albeit several works have proposed new techniques for developing diversity-aware recommendations, little is known about how people perceive diversity while interacting with music recommendations. In this study, we interview several listeners about the role that diversity plays in their listening experience, trying to get a better understanding of how they interact with music recommendations. We recruit the listeners among the participants of a previous quantitative study, where they were confronted with the notion of diversity when asked to identify, from a series of electronic music lists, the most diverse ones according to their beliefs. As a follow-up, in this qualitative study we carry out semi-structured interviews to understand how listeners may assess the diversity of a music list and to investigate their experiences with music recommendation diversity. We report here our main findings on 1) what can influence the diversity assessment of tracks and artists\u2019 music lists, and 2) which factors can characterize listeners\u2019 interaction with music recommendation diversity.",

In this work, we monitor, quantify and reflect on the diversity in ACII conference across time by computing a set of indexes. We measure diversity in terms of gender, geographic location and academia vs research centres vs industry, and consider three different actors: authors, keynote speakers and organizers. Results raise awareness on the limited diversity in the field, in all studied facets, and compared to other AI conferences. While gender diversity is relatively high, equality is far from being reached. The community is dominated by European, Asian and North American researchers, leading the rest of continents under-represented. There is also a strong absence of companies and research centres focusing on applied research and products. This study fosters discussion in the community on the need for diversity and related challenges in terms of minimizing potential biases of the developed systems to the represented groups.

Partly driven by the commercial application of this technology, music recommendation research has gained increasing attention both within and outside the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community. Thanks also to the widespread use of recommender systems in music streaming services, it has been possible to enhance several characteristics of such systems in terms of performance, design, and user experience. Nonetheless, imagining Music RS only from an application-driven perspective may generate an incomplete view of how this technology is affecting people\u2019s habitus, from the decision-making processes to the formation of musical taste and opinions. In this overview, we address the concept of diversity in music recommendation, and taking a value-driven approach we review diversity-related methodologies proposed in the Music RS literature. Additionally, by taking as an example the wider context of Information Technology (IT), we present the elements interacting in the diversity by design paradigm. We do that to acknowledge the lack of a comprehensive framework in Music RS research to address diversity, until now mostly driven by empirical results and fragmented in different application areas. Maintaining an interdisciplinary perspective, we discuss some challenges that MIR practitioners may face when researching Music RS, going beyond the search for better performance and instead questioning the theoretical foundations on which to base future research.",

Even if fields such as Musicology or Sociology of Music have a long tradition in questioning the representation and the impact of diversity in cultural environments, such knowledge has not been yet embedded into the design and development of music technologies. In this paper, focusing on electronic music, we investigate the characteristics of listeners, artists, and tracks that are influential in the perception of diversity. Specifically, we center our attention on 1) understanding the relationship between perceived diversity and computational methods to measure diversity, and 2) analyzing how listeners' domain knowledge and familiarity influence such perceived diversity. To accomplish this, we design a user-study in which listeners are asked to compare pairs of lists of tracks and artists, and to select the most diverse list from each pair. We compare participants' ratings with results obtained through computational models built using audio tracks' features and artist attributes. We find that such models are generally aligned with participants' choices when most of them agree that one list is more diverse than the other, while they present a mixed behaviour in cases where participants have little agreement. Moreover, we observe how differences in domain knowledge, familiarity, and demographics can influence the level of agreement among listeners, and between listeners and diversity metrics computed automatically.",
