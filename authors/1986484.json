            "title": "Alleviating Structural Distribution Shift in Graph Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a challenging binary classification problem due to its different structural distribution between anomalies and normal nodes --- abnormal nodes are a minority, therefore holding high heterophily and low homophily compared to normal nodes. Furthermore, due to various time factors and the annotation preferences of human experts, the heterophily and homophily can change across training and testing data, which is called structural distribution shift (SDS) in this paper. The mainstream methods are built on graph neural networks (GNNs), benefiting the classification of normals from aggregating homophilous neighbors, yet ignoring the SDS issue for anomalies and suffering from poor generalization. This work solves the problem from a feature view. We observe that the degree of SDS varies between anomalies and normal nodes. Hence to address the issue, the key lies in resisting high heterophily for anomalies meanwhile benefiting the learning of normals from homophily. Since different labels correspond to the difference of critical anomaly features which make great contributions to the GAD, we tease out the anomaly features on which we constrain to mitigate the effect of heterophilous neighbors and make them invariant. However, the prior distribution of anomaly features is dynamic and hard to estimate, we thus devise a prototype vector to infer and update this distribution during training. For normal nodes, we constrain the remaining features to preserve the connectivity of nodes and reinforce the influence of the homophilous neighborhood. We term our proposed framework asGraph Decomposition Network (GDN). Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, and the proposed framework achieves a remarkable performance boost in GAD, especially in an SDS environment where anomalies have largely different structural distribution across training and testing environments.

            "abstract": "Reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDH-EI) is instrumental in image privacy protection and data embedding. However, conventional RDH-EI models, involving image providers, data hiders, and receivers, limit the number of data hiders to one, which restricts its applicability in scenarios requiring multiple data embedders. Therefore, the need for an RDH-EI accommodating multiple data hiders, especially for copyright protection, has become crucial. Addressing this, we introduce the application of Pixel Value Order (PVO) technology to encrypted reversible data hiding, combined with the secret image sharing (SIS) scheme. This creates a novel scheme, PVO, Chaotic System, Secret Sharing-based Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted Image (PCSRDH-EI), which satisfies the (k,n) threshold property. An image is partitioned into N shadow images, and reconstruction is feasible when at least k shadow images are available. This method enables separate data extraction and image decryption. Our scheme combines stream encryption, based on chaotic systems, with secret sharing, underpinned by the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT), ensuring secure secret sharing. Empirical tests show that PCSRDH-EI can reach a maximum embedding rate of 5.706 bpp, outperforming the state-of-the-art and demonstrating superior encryption effects.",

            "title": "Addressing Heterophily in Graph Anomaly Detection: A Perspective of Graph Spectrum",
            "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) suffers from heterophily \u2014 abnormal nodes are sparse so that they are connected to vast normal nodes. The current solutions upon Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) blindly smooth the representation of neiboring nodes, thus undermining the discriminative information of the anomalies. To alleviate the issue, recent studies identify and discard inter-class edges through estimating and comparing the node-level representation similarity. However, the representation of a single node can be misleading when the prediction error is high, thus hindering the performance of the edge indicator. In graph signal processing, the smoothness index is a widely adopted metric which plays the role of frequency in classical spectral analysis. Considering the ground truth Y to be a signal on graph, the smoothness index is equivalent to the value of the heterophily ratio. From this perspective, we aim to address the heterophily problem in the spectral domain. First, we point out that heterophily is positively associated with the frequency of a graph. Towards this end, we could prune inter-class edges by simply emphasizing and delineating the high-frequency components of the graph. Recall that graph Laplacian is a high-pass filter, we adopt it to measure the extent of 1-hop label changing of the center node and indicate high-frequency components. As GAD can be formulated as a semi-supervised binary classification problem, only part of the nodes are labeled. As an alternative, we use the prediction of the nodes to estimate it. Through our analysis, we show that prediction errors are less likely to affect the identification process. Extensive empirical evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the indicator over popular homophilic, heterophilic, and tailored fraud detection methods. Our proposed indicator can effectively reduce the heterophily degree of the graph, thus boosting the overall GAD performance. Codes are open-sourced in https://github.com/blacksingular/GHRN.",

            "abstract": "Threshold attribute-based credentials are suitable for decentralized systems such as blockchains as such systems generally assume that authenticity, confidentiality, and availability can still be guaranteed in the presence of a threshold number of dishonest or faulty nodes. Coconut (NDSS\u201919) was the first selective disclosure attribute-based credentials scheme supporting threshold issuance. However, it does not support threshold tracing of user identities and threshold revocation of user credentials, which is desired for internal governance such as identity management, data auditing, and accountability. The communication and computation complexities of Coconut for verifying credentials are linear in the number of each user's attributes and thus costly. Addressing these issues, we propose a novel efficient threshold attribute-based anonymous credential scheme. While retaining all the features of Coconut, our scheme supports threshold tracing of user identities and threshold revocation of user credentials, and it significantly reduces the computational and communication complexities of credential verification. In addition, we prove that our scheme enjoys strong security features, including anonymity, blindness, traceability, and non-frameability.",

            "abstract": "Modern cryptography attributes the security of a cryptographic system to the security of the key. How to securely distribute the key has always been a bottleneck in key management. This paper proposes a secure group key agreement scheme for multiple parties using a multiple twinning superlattice physical unclonable function (PUF) that can be synchronized. By sharing the challenge and helper data among multiple twinning superlattice PUF holders, the scheme employs a reusable fuzzy extractor to obtain the key locally. Moreover, adopting public-key encryption encrypts public data for establishing the subgroup key, which provides independent communication for the subgroup. At the same time, when the subgroup membership changes, the public key encrypts new public data to update the subgroup key, forming scalable group communication. This paper also presents a cost and formal security analysis, which shows that the proposed scheme can achieve computational security by applying the key obtained by the computationally secure reusable fuzzy extractor to the EAV-secure symmetric-key encryption, which has indistinguishable encryption in the presence of an eavesdropper. Additionally, the scheme is secure against physical attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and machine learning modeling attacks.",

It is a means to analyze the network security quantitatively. Although NSSA has received extensive attention and exploration, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews of the related technologies. This paper presents a state-of-the-art study on NSSA that can help bridge the current research status and future large-scale application.

            "abstract": "Despite the tremendous success, deep neural networks are exposed to serious IP infringement risks. Given a target deep model, if the attacker knows its full information, it can be easily stolen by fine-tuning. Even if only its output is accessible, a surrogate model can be trained through student-teacher learning by generating many input-output training pairs. Therefore, deep model IP protection is important and necessary. However, it is still seriously under-researched. In this work, we propose a new model watermarking framework for protecting deep networks trained for low-level computer vision or image processing tasks. Specifically, a special task-agnostic barrier is added after the target model, which embeds a unified and invisible watermark into its outputs. When the attacker trains one surrogate model by using the input-output pairs of the barrier target model, the hidden watermark will be learned and extracted afterwards. To enable watermarks from binary bits to high-resolution images, a deep invisible watermarking mechanism is designed. By jointly training the target model and watermark embedding, the extra barrier can even be absorbed into the target model. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework, which can resist attacks with different network structures and objective functions.",

In this work, considering the features of the same object instance are highly similar among frames in a video, a novel Temporal ROI Align operator is proposed to extract features from other frames feature maps for current frame proposals by utilizing feature similarity. The proposed Temporal ROI Align operator can extract temporal information from the entire video for proposals.

            "title": "Reversible Watermarking in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Integrity Authentication",
            "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks have made outstanding contributions in many fields such as computer vision in the past few years and many researchers published well-trained network for downloading. But recent studies have shown serious concerns about integrity due to model-reuse attacks and backdoor attacks. In order to protect these open-source networks, many algorithms have been proposed such as watermarking. However, these existing algorithms modify the contents of the network permanently and are not suitable for integrity authentication. In this paper, we propose a reversible watermarking algorithm for integrity authentication. Specifically, we present the reversible watermarking problem of deep convolutional neural networks and utilize the pruning theory of model compression technology to construct a host sequence used for embedding watermarking information by histogram shift. As shown in the experiments, the influence of embedding reversible watermarking on the classification performance is less than \u00b10.5% and the parameters of the model can be fully recovered after extracting the watermarking. At the same time, the integrity of the model can be verified by applying the reversible watermarking: if the model is modified illegally, the authentication information generated by original model will be absolutely different from the extracted watermarking information.",

            "abstract": "Cryptography is the core and foundation of information security. Key management is an important means of cryptography. It guarantees key security throughout the lifecycle of key generation, distribution, storage, update, query, and destruction. In the video surveillance system, monitoring video storage, sharing, retrieval, etc. face many security threats. In this paper, a key management scheme is designed for video surveillance system based on Identity-Based Cryptograph and relevant national standards to enhance the security of video monitoring system. This paper analyzes the characteristics of various keys in the video surveillance system, studies the key management function, and proposes a scheme for the negotiation, generation, distribution, update, storage and query of keys. In this scheme, SM9 identification cryptography algorithm is used for authentication, SM4 symmetric cryptography algorithm is used for data encryption, and SM3 hash algorithm is used for data integrity verification, scheduling real-time video surveillance data in the system and Management to ensure the safety and reliability of the system.",
