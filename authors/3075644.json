            "title": "GraLMatch: Matching Groups of Entities with Graphs and Language Models",
            "abstract": "In this paper, we present an end-to-end multi-source Entity Matching problem, which we call entity group matching, where the goal is to assign to the same group, records originating from multiple data sources but representing the same real-world entity. We focus on the effects of transitively matched records, i.e. the records connected by paths in the graph G = (V,E) whose nodes and edges represent the records and whether they are a match or not. We present a real-world instance of this problem, where the challenge is to match records of companies and financial securities originating from different data providers. We also introduce two new multi-source benchmark datasets that present similar matching challenges as real-world records. A distinctive characteristic of these records is that they are regularly updated following real-world events, but updates are not applied uniformly across data sources. This phenomenon makes the matching of certain groups of records only possible through the use of transitive information. In our experiments, we illustrate how considering transitively matched records is challenging since a limited amount of false positive pairwise match predictions can throw off the group assignment of large quantities of records. Thus, we propose GraLMatch, a method that can partially detect and remove false positive pairwise predictions through graph-based properties. Finally, we showcase how fine-tuning a Transformer-based model (DistilBERT) on a reduced number of labeled samples yields a better final entity group matching than training on more samples and/or incorporating fine-tuning optimizations, illustrating how precision becomes the deciding factor in the entity group matching of large volumes of records.",

            "abstract": "\"Data Scientist\" has often been considered as the sexiest job of the 21st century. As a consequence, the spectrum of data science education programs has increased significantly in recent years, and there is a high demand for data scientists at many companies. However, what training is required to become a data scientist? What is the role of data scientists in current enterprises? Is the training well-aligned to the practical needs of a job? In this article, we will address these questions by evaluating a survey of people who were trained in a continuing education program in data science in Switzerland. Our study sheds lights on the practical aspects of the data science education and how this newly-gained knowledge can successfully be applied in an enterprise. One of the highlights from the point of view of the database community is the important role of SQL in data science.",

Such systems are a real opportunity for our community to cater to users with different domain and data science expertise. We introduce INODE - an end-to-end data exploration system - that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Research, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.",

            "abstract": "The traditional approach of querying a relational database is via a formal language, namely SQL. Recent developments in the design of natural language interfaces to databases show promising results for querying either with keywords or with full natural language queries and thus render relational databases more accessible to non-tech savvy users. Such enhanced relational databases basically use a search paradigm which is commonly used in the field of information retrieval. However, the way systems are evaluated in the database and the information retrieval communities often differs due to a lack of common benchmarks. In this paper, we provide an adapted benchmark data set that is based on a test collection originally used to evaluate information retrieval systems. The data set contains 45 information needs developed on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), including corresponding relevance assessments. By mapping this benchmark data set to a relational database schema, we enable a novel way of directly comparing database search techniques with information retrieval. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we present an experimental evaluation that compares SODA, a keyword-enabled relational database system, against the Terrier information retrieval system and thus lays the foundation for a future discussion of evaluating database systems that support natural language interfaces.",

            "abstract": "We propose approaches that use information retrieval methods for the automatic calculation of CO2-footprints of cooking recipes. A particular challenge is the \u201clong tail problem\u201d that arises with the large diversity of possible ingredients. The proposed approaches are generalizable to other use cases in which a numerical value for semi-structured items has to be calculated, for example, the calculation of the insurance value of a property based on a real estate listing. Our \ufb01rst approach, ingredient matching, calculates the CO2-footprint based on the ingredient descriptions that are matched to food products in a language resource and therefore suffers from the long tail problem. On the other hand, our second approach directly uses the recipe to estimate the CO2-value based on its closest neighbor using an adapted version of the BM25 weighting scheme. Furthermore, we combine these two approaches in order to achieve a more reliable estimate. Our experiments show that the automatically calculated CO2-value estimates lie within an acceptable range compared to the manually calculated values. Therefore, the costs of the calculation of the CO2-footprints can be reduced dramatically by using the automatic approaches. This helps to make the information available to a large audience in order to increase the awareness and transparency of the environmental impact of food consumption.",

            "abstract": "False alarms triggered by security sensors incur high costs for all parties involved. According to police reports, a large majority of alarms are false. Recent advances in machine learning can enable automatically classifying alarms. However, building a scalable alarm verification system is a challenge, since the system needs to: (1) process thousands of alarms in real-time, (2) classify false alarms with high accuracy and (3) perform historic data analysis to enable better insights into the results for human operators. This requires a mix of machine learning, stream and batch processing \u2013 technologies which are typically optimized independently. We combine all three into a single, real-world application. This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of an alarm verification system we developed jointly with Sitasys, the market leader in alarm transmission in central Europe. Our system can process around 30K alarms per second with a verification accuracy of above 90%.",

Instead of evaluating specific components, e.g. solely the search engine, a complete IR application, including the user's perspective, is evaluated. The evaluation methodology is designed to be applicable to operational IR applications. The black box evaluation methodology could be packaged into an evaluation and monitoring tool, making it usable for industry stakeholders. The tool should lead practitioners through the evaluation process and maintain the test results for the manual and automatic tests. This paper shows that the methodology is generalizable, even though the diversity of IR applications is high. The challenges in automating tests are the simulation of tasks that require intellectual effort and the handling of different visualizations of the same concept.",

A call was made for proposals for both types of labs, with 9 proposals being submitted in late October of 2009. Five of these were accepted as benchmarking activites, and two were accepted as exploration workshops. Each submitted proposal was reviewed by the CLEF2010 lab organizing committee, with final decisions of acceptance and length of labs determined by the following criteria.",

In many areas there is still a considerable gap between the results achieved by the research community and their implementation in commercial applications.

Originally started as a track at the TREC-6 conference, CLEF became an independent initiative in 2000 when the coordination moved to Europe. The diversity of languages commonly spoken in Europe has led to a multilingual, distributed setup that was chosen to best accommodate the unique linguistic properties of each language and the implications for topic development and relevance assessments. The tasks in CLEF 2000 involved a multilingual document collection in four core languages and several additional topic languages. Twenty groups participated in the campaign, submitting a wide range of experiments. The test collection was subsequently analyzed with respect to the completeness of the assessments in order to ensure the validity for future evaluation and benchmarking activities. CLEF will continue in 2001, with several additions to the individual tasks.",

We also looked at different ways of merging individual crosslanguage retrieval runs to produce multilingual result lists. We participated in both the CLIR main task and the GIRT sub task.",

            "abstract": "This year the Zurich team participated in two tracks: the automatic-adhoc track and the crosslingual track. For the adhoc task we focused on improving retrieval for short queries. We pursued two aims. First, we investigated weighting functions for short queries|explicitely without any kind of automatic query expansion. Second we developed rules that automatically decide for which queries automatic expansion works ne and for which it does not. For the cross-language track, we approached the problem of retrieving documents from a multilingual document pool containing documents in all TREC CLIR languages. Our method uses individual runs for di erent language combinations, followed by merging their results into one nal ranked list. We obtained good results without sophisticated machine translation or costly linguistic resources.",
