We collect and use exclusively textual features (title, description and body) of articles. Our best model is a stacking of 14 Transformer-based Language models fine-tuned on single or multiple fields, using data in the original language or translated to English. It placed fourth on the original leaderboard, sixth on the complete official one and fourth on the English-subset official one. We observe the data collection as our principal source of error due to a relevant fraction of missing or wrong fields.",

            "abstract": "We monitor online conversations of Italian users around vaccines on Twitter, and we provide public access to the on-going data collection which will run continuously throughout the vaccination campaign taking place in Italy. We started collecting tweets matching vaccine-related keywords (in Italian) on December 20th 2020 using Twitter APIs, capturing the Italian vaccine rollout (27th December 2020), and at the time of this writing (13th January 2020) we collected over 1.8 M tweets, with an average number of 30k tweets shared on a daily basis. We report a consistent amount of low-credibility information already circulating on Twitter alongside vaccine-related conversations, whose prevalence is smaller yet comparable to high-credibility information. We believe that our data will allow researchers to understand the interplay between public discourse on online social media and the evolution of the on-going vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 taking place in Italy.",

            "abstract": "One year after the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2, several vaccines have been successfully developed to prevent its spreading, and vaccine roll-out campaigns are taking place world-wide. However, an increasing number of individuals is still hesitant towards getting vaccinated, and this poses a serious threat to reaching herd immunity. We collect and analyze Italian online conversations about COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter. We de\ufb01ne a hashtag-based semi-automatic approach to label large volumes of tweets as supporters or skeptical about the vaccine. We investigate the geographical, temporal and lexical distribution of data, and we train an accurate binary classi\ufb01er that predicts the stance of tweets towards vaccines, i.e., it applies a \u201cPro-vax\u201d or \u201cNo-vax\u201d label. This classi\ufb01-cation approach can be used, in parallel with other af\ufb01rmed techniques, to promptly detect and prevent the spread of negative and misleading messages about vaccines, ensuring higher rates of vaccine uptake.",

            "abstract": "On September 2020 a constitutional referendum was held in Italy. In this work we collect a dataset of 1.2M tweets related to this event, with particular interest to the textual content shared, and we design a hashtag-based semi-automatic approach to label them as Supporters or Against the referendum. We use the labelled dataset to train a classifier based on transformers, unsupervisedly pre-trained on Italian corpora. Our model generalizes well on tweets that cannot be labeled by the hashtag-based approach. We check that no length-, lexicon- and sentiment-biases are present to affect the performance of the classifier. Finally, we discuss the discrepancy between the magnitudes of tweets expressing a specific stance, obtained using both the hashtag-based approach and our trained classifier, and the real outcome of the referendum: the referendum was approved by 70% of the voters, while the number of tweets against the referendum is four times greater than the number of tweets supporting it. We conclude that the Italian referendum was an example of event where the minority was very loud on social media, highly influencing the perception of the event. Analyzing only the activity on social media is dangerous and can lead to extremely wrong forecasts.",

            "title": "Exploiting Twitter as Source of Large Corpora of Weakly Similar Pairs for Semantic Sentence Embeddings",
            "abstract": "Semantic sentence embeddings are usually supervisedly built minimizing distances between pairs of embeddings of sentences labelled as semantically similar by annotators. Since big labelled datasets are rare, in particular for non-English languages, and expensive, recent studies focus on unsupervised approaches that require not-paired input sentences. We instead propose a language-independent approach to build large datasets of pairs of informal texts weakly similar, without manual human effort, exploiting Twitter\u2019s intrinsic powerful signals of relatedness: replies and quotes of tweets. We use the collected pairs to train a Transformer model with triplet-like structures, and we test the generated embeddings on Twitter NLP similarity tasks (PIT and TURL) and STSb. We also introduce four new sentence ranking evaluation benchmarks of informal texts, carefully extracted from the initial collections of tweets, proving not only that our best model learns classical Semantic Textual Similarity, but also excels on tasks where pairs of sentences are not exact paraphrases. Ablation studies reveal how increasing the corpus size influences positively the results, even at 2M samples, suggesting that bigger collections of Tweets still do not contain redundant information about semantic similarities.

            "abstract": "Over the last decades, communication between governments and citizens has become a remarkable problem. Governments\u2019 decisions do not always match the visions of the citizens about the future. Achieving such alignment requires cooperation between communities and public institutions. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to innovate governance and policymaking, developing new ways to harness the potential of public engagement and participatory foresight in complex governance decisions. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework that combines crowdsourcing and data analysis to improve the crowd\u2019s collective engagement and contribution in policy-making decisions. Our approach brings together social networking, gami\ufb01cation, and data analysis practices to extract relevant and co-ordinated future visions concerning public policies. The framework is validated through two experiments with citizens and policy-making domain experts. The \ufb01ndings con\ufb01rm the effectiveness of the framework principles and provide useful feedback for future development.",

Among different tasks, \ufb01nding solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is one of the most intriguing problems, as there may be advantages over well established and robust classical approaches. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to \ufb01nd all possible solutions of an ordinary differential equation that has multiple solutions, using arti\ufb01cial neural networks. The key idea is the introduction of a new loss term that we call the interaction loss . The interaction loss prevents different solutions families from co-inciding. We carried out experiments with two nonlinear differential equations, all admitting more than one solution, to show the effectiveness of our algorithm, and we performed a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of different hyper-parameters.",

By using publicly shared tweets, we developed a stance classification model to evaluate the change of stance over time. We also extracted the key topics of the long-running debate, studying which political side have discussed them most and what is the general sentiment on each. We also revealed the participation of bot accounts, and we found that the higher the bot score, the more likely the account is in a pro-Leave position.

This is known as the \"volunteer's dilemma\": everybody wants to benefit from a resource without contributing, expecting others will do the work. This paper explores whether this problem also arises in open source development. In particular, we analyze the behaviour of GitHub users to assess whether the 90-9-1 principle applies to open source. We study it both from a qualitative (ratio of activity types) and a quantitative (total number of activities) perspective and we show that the principle does not hold if we consider the GitHub platform as a whole. Surprisingly, results are reversed depending on the specific projects we look at. We believe these results are useful to project managers to better understand and optimize the behaviour of the community around their projects and, as a side effect, they show the importance of diversity in sample selection.",
