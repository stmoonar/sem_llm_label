            "abstract": "Abstract Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is an important task with broad applications, and few-shot HTC has gained increasing interest recently. While in-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) has achieved significant success in few-shot learning, it is not as effective for HTC because of the expansive hierarchical label sets and extremely ambiguous labels. In this work, we introduce the first ICL-based framework with LLM for few-shot HTC. We exploit a retrieval database to identify relevant demonstrations, and an iterative policy to manage multi-layer hierarchical labels. Particularly, we equip the retrieval database with HTC label-aware representations for the input texts, which is achieved by continual training on a pretrained language model with masked language modeling (MLM), layer-wise classification (CLS, specifically for HTC), and a novel divergent contrastive learning (DCL, mainly for adjacent semantically similar labels) objective. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of our method, and we can achieve state-of-the-art results in few-shot HTC.",

            "abstract": "Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) aims to mine and transfer users' sequential preferences across different domains to alleviate the long-standing cold-start issue. Traditional CDSR models capture collaborative information through user and item modeling while overlooking valuable semantic information. Recently, Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated powerful semantic reasoning capabilities, motivating us to introduce them to better capture semantic information. However, introducing LLMs to CDSR is non-trivial due to two crucial issues: seamless information integration and domain-specific generation. To this end, we propose a novel framework named URLLM, which aims to improve the CDSR performance by exploring the User Retrieval approach and domain grounding on LLM simultaneously. Specifically, we first present a novel dual-graph sequential model to capture the diverse information, along with an alignment and contrastive learning method to facilitate domain knowledge transfer. Subsequently, a user retrieve-generation model is adopted to seamlessly integrate the structural information into LLM, fully harnessing its emergent inferencing ability. Furthermore, we propose a domain-specific strategy and a refinement module to prevent out-of-domain generation. Extensive experiments on Amazon demonstrated the information integration and domain-specific generation ability of URLLM in comparison to state-of-the-art baselines.

            "abstract": "Online Travel Platforms (OTPs) have been working on improving their hotel Search & Ranking (S&R) systems that facilitate efficient matching between consumers and hotels. Existing OTPs focus on improving platform revenue. In this work, we take a first step in incorporating hotel merchants' objectives into the design of hotel S&R systems to achieve an incentive loop: the OTP tilts impressions and better-ranked positions to merchants with high service quality, and in return, the merchants provide better service to consumers. Three critical design challenges need to be resolved to achieve this incentive loop: Matthew Effect in the consumer feedback-loop, unclear relation between hotel service quality and performance, and conflicts between platform revenue and consumer experience. To address these challenges, we propose MERIT, a MERchant InceTive ranking model, which can simultaneously take the interests of merchants and consumers into account. We introduce information about the hotel service quality at the input-output level. At the input level, we incorporate factors of hotel service quality as features (as the underlying reasons for service quality), while at the output level, we introduce the metric Hotel Rating Score (HRS) as a label (as the evaluated outcome of service quality). Also, we design a monotonic structure for Merchant Tower to provide a clear relation between hotel quality and performance. Finally, we propose a Multi-objective Stratified Pairwise Loss, which can mitigate the conflicts between OTP's revenue and consumer experience. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MERIT, we compare our method with several state-of-the-art benchmarks. The offline experiment results indicate that MERIT outperforms these methods in optimizing the demands of consumers and merchants. Furthermore, we conduct an online A/B test and obtain an improvement of 3.02% for the HRS score. Based on these results, we have deployed MERIT online on Fliggy, one of the most popular OTPs in China, to serve tens of millions of consumers and hundreds of thousands of hotel merchants.

            "abstract": "Personalized recommendation has been instrumental in many real applications. Despite the great progress, the underlying multi-scenario characteristics (e.g., users may behave differently under different scenarios) are largely ignored by existing recommender systems. Intuitively, modeling different scenarios properly could significantly improve the recommendation accuracy, and some existing work has explored this direction. However, these work assumes the scenarios are explicitly given, and thus becomes less effective when such information is unavailable. To complicate things further, proper scenario modeling from data is challenging and the recommendation models may easily overfit to some scenarios. In this paper, we propose a multi-scenario learning framework, MUSENET, for personalized recommendation. The key idea of MUSENET is to learn multiple implicit scenarios from the user behaviors, with a careful design inspired by the causal interpretation of recommender systems to avoid the overfitting issue. Additionally, since users' repeat consumptions account for a large part of the user behavior data on many e-commerce platforms, a repeat-aware mechanism is integrated to handle users' repurchase intentions within each scenario. Comprehensive experimental results on both industrial and public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

Specifically, we first employ a user constant viewing flow modeling method to summarize the user's general interest to recommend articles. In this case, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to capture constant user preferences from previously clicked articles, such as skills and positions. Then we design the user instant viewing flow modeling method to build interactions between user-clicked article history and candidate articles. It attentively reads the representations of user-clicked articles and aims to learn the user's different interest views to match the candidate article. Our experimental results on the Alibaba Technology Association (ATA) website show the advantage of SINGLE, achieving a 2.4% improvement over previous baseline models in the online A/B test. Our further analyses illustrate that SINGLE has the ability to build a more tailored recommendation system by mimicking different article viewing behaviors of users and recommending more appropriate and diverse articles to match user interests.",

To address this issue, existing efforts have mainly been dedicated to improving the robustness of GNNs, while little attention has been paid to the detection of such attacks. In this work, we study the victim node detection problem under topology attacks against GNNs. Our approach is built upon the key observation rooted in the intrinsic message passing nature of GNNs. That is, the neighborhood of a victim node tends to have two competing group forces, pushing the node classification results towards the original label and the targeted label, respectively. Based on this observation, we propose to detect victim nodes by deliberately designing an effective measurement of the neighborhood variance for each node. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets and five existing topology attacks show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed detection approach.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in a variety of real-world applications by relying on the fixed graph data as input. However, the initial input graph might not be optimal in terms of specific downstream tasks, because of information scarcity, noise, adversarial attacks, or discrepancies between the distribution in graph topology, features, and groundtruth labels. In this paper, we propose a bi-level optimization approach for learning the optimal graph structure via directly learning the Personalized PageRank propagation matrix as well as the downstream semi-supervised node classification simultaneously. We also explore a low-rank approximation model for further reducing the time complexity. Empirical evaluations show the superior efficacy and robustness of the proposed model over all baseline methods.",

            "abstract": "Online travel platforms (OTPs), e.g., bookings.com and Ctrip.com, deliver travel experiences to online users by providing travel-related products. Although much progress has been made, the state-of-the-arts for cold-start problems are largely sub-optimal for user representation, since they do not take into account the unique characteristics exhibited from user travel behaviors. In this work, we propose a State-aware Multi-aspect Interests representation Network (SMINet) for cold-start users recommendation at OTPs, which consists of a multi-aspect interests extractor, a co-attention layer, and a state-aware gating layer. The key component of the model is the multi-aspect interests extractor, which is able to extract representations for the user's multi-aspect interests. Furthermore, to learn the interactions between the user behaviors in the current session and the above multi-aspect interests, we carefully design a co-attention layer which allows the cross attentions between the two modules. Additionally, we propose a travel state-aware gating layer to attentively select the multi-aspect interests. The final user representation is obtained by fusing the three components. Comprehensive experiments conducted both offline and online demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model at user representation, especially for cold-start users, compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Online travel platforms (OTPs), e.g., booking.com and Ctrip.com, deliver travel experiences to online users by providing travel-related products. One key problem facing OTPs is to predict users' future travel destination, which has many important applications, e.g., proactively recommending users flight tickets or hotels in the destination city. Although much progress has been made for the next POI recommendation, they are largely sub-optimal for travel destination prediction on OTPs, due to the unique characteristics exhibited from users' travel behaviors such as offline spatial-temporal periodicity and online multi-interest exploration. In this paper, we propose an online-offline periodicity-aware information gain network, OOPIN, for travel destination prediction on OTPs. The key components of the model are (1) an offline mobility pattern extractor, which extracts spatial-temporal periodicity along with the sequential dependencies from the visited city sequence; and (2) an online multi-interests exploration module that discovers destinations that the user might be interested in but not yet visited from their online interaction data.Comprehensive experiments on real-world OTP demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model for travel destination prediction compared with state-of-the-art methods.",
