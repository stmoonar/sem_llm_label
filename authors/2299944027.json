            "title": "Optimal Baseline Corrections for Off-Policy Contextual Bandits",
            "abstract": "The off-policy learning paradigm allows for recommender systems and general ranking applications to be framed as decision-making problems, where we aim to learn decision policies that optimize an unbiased offline estimate of an online reward metric. With unbiasedness comes potentially high variance, and prevalent methods exist to reduce estimation variance. These methods typically make use of control variates, either additive (i.e., baseline corrections or doubly robust methods) or multiplicative (i.e., self-normalisation). Our work unifies these approaches by proposing a single framework built on their equivalence in learning scenarios. The foundation of our framework is the derivation of an equivalent baseline correction for all of the existing control variates. Consequently, our framework enables us to characterize the variance-optimal unbiased estimator and provide a closed-form solution for it. This optimal estimator brings significantly improved performance in both evaluation and learning, and minimizes data requirements. Empirical observations corroborate our theoretical findings.",

            "title": "A Simple Model to Estimate Sharing Effects in Social Networks",
            "abstract": "Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for estimating treatment effects across many fields of science. Technology companies have adopted A/B-testing methods as a modern RCT counterpart, where end-users are randomly assigned various system variants and user behaviour is tracked continuously. The objective is then to estimate the causal effect that the treatment variant would have on certain metrics of interest to the business. When the outcomes for randomisation units -- end-users in this case -- are not statistically independent, this obfuscates identifiability of treatment effects, and harms decision-makers' observability of the system. Social networks exemplify this, as they are designed to promote inter-user interactions. This interference by design notoriously complicates measurement of, e.g., the effects of sharing. In this work, we propose a simple Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based model describing user sharing behaviour in social networks. We derive an unbiased estimator for treatment effects under this model, and demonstrate through reproducible synthetic experiments that it outperforms existing methods by a significant margin.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems make algorithmic decisions about what will be shown to whom, billions of times every day across the web. These decisions have consequences that can often be far-reaching. Indeed, users that are exposed to certain items, might be convinced to explore interests that are novel to them. At the same time, exposure is often linked to economic incentives for the item producer, which platform-level metrics will be impacted by as well. Feedback loops in existing systems also imply that algorithmic decisions made by the model itself, have an impact on the data future model iterations will be trained and evaluated on. The literature on the intersection of recommender systems, and causal or counterfactual inference, is often focused on short-term, user-focused metrics. Nevertheless, as algorithmic consequences influence many stakeholders, it is our belief that a broader holistic view of the problem can lead to an improved understanding of these systems that touch upon many people\u2019s daily lives. The 2nd edition of the CONSEQUENCES workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners who are interested in this research topic, and wish to help shape its future.",

            "title": "Off-Policy Learning-to-Bid with AuctionGym",
            "abstract": "Online advertising opportunities are sold through auctions, billions of times every day across the web. Advertisers who participate in those auctions need to decide on a bidding strategy: how much they are willing to bid for a given impression opportunity. Deciding on such a strategy is not a straightforward task, because of the interactive and reactive nature of the repeated auction mechanism. Indeed, an advertiser does not observe counterfactual outcomes of bid amounts that were not submitted, and successful advertisers will adapt their own strategies based on bids placed by competitors. These characteristics complicate effective learning and evaluation of bidding strategies based on logged data alone. The interactive and reactive nature of the bidding problem lends itself to a bandit or reinforcement learning formulation, where a bidding strategy can be optimised to maximise cumulative rewards. Several design choices then need to be made regarding parameterisation, model-based or model-free approaches, and the formulation of the objective function. This work provides a unified framework for such \"learning to bid'' methods, showing how many existing approaches fall under the value-based paradigm. We then introduce novel policy-based and doubly robust formulations of the bidding problem. To allow for reliable and reproducible offline validation of such methods without relying on sensitive proprietary data, we introduce AuctionGym: a simulation environment that enables the use of bandit learning for bidding strategies in online advertising auctions. We present results from a suite of experiments under varying environmental conditions, unveiling insights that can guide practitioners who need to decide on a model class. Empirical observations highlight the effectiveness of our newly proposed methods. AuctionGym is released under an open-source license, and we expect the research community to benefit from this tool.",
