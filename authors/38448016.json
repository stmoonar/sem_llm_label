            "title": "Cross-CBAM: A Lightweight network for Scene Segmentation",
            "abstract": "Scene parsing is a great challenge for real-time semantic segmentation. Although traditional semantic segmentation networks have made remarkable leap-forwards in semantic accuracy, the performance of inference speed is unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, this progress is achieved with fairly large networks and powerful computational resources. However, it is difficult to run extremely large models on edge computing devices with limited computing power, which poses a huge challenge to the real-time semantic segmentation tasks. In this paper, we present the Cross-CBAM network, a novel lightweight network for real-time semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Squeeze-and-Excitation Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling Module(SE-ASPP) is proposed to get variable field-of-view and multiscale information. And we propose a Cross Convolutional Block Attention Module(CCBAM), in which a cross-multiply operation is employed in the CCBAM module to make high-level semantic information guide low-level detail information. Different from previous work, these works use attention to focus on the desired information in the backbone. CCBAM uses cross-attention for feature fusion in the FPN structure. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset and Camvid dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Cross-CBAM model by achieving a promising trade-off between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. On the Cityscapes test set, we achieve 73.4% mIoU with a speed of 240.9FPS and 77.2% mIoU with a speed of 88.6FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti.",

            "title": "Anisotropic Generalized Bayesian Coherent Point Drift for Point Set Registration",
            "abstract": "Registration is highly demanded in many real-world scenarios such as robotics and automation. Registration is challenging partly due to the fact that the acquired data is usually noisy and has many outliers. In addition, in many practical applications, one point set (PS) usually only covers a partial region of the other PS. Thus, most existing registration algorithms cannot guarantee theoretical convergence. This article presents a novel, robust, and accurate three-dimensional (3D) rigid point set registration (PSR) method, which is achieved by generalizing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) Bayesian coherent point drift (BCPD) theory to the scenario that high-dimensional point sets (PSs) are aligned and the anisotropic positional noise is considered. The high-dimensional point sets typically consist of the positional vectors and normal vectors. On one hand, with the normal vectors, the proposed method is more robust to noise and outliers, and the point correspondences can be found more accurately. On the other hand, incorporating the registration into the BCPD framework will guarantee the algorithm\u2019s theoretical convergence. Our contributions in this article are three folds. First, the problem of rigidly aligning two general PSs with normal vectors is incorporated into a variational Bayesian inference framework, which is solved by generalizing the BCPD approach while the anisotropic positional noise is considered. Second, the updated parameters during the algorithm\u2019s iterations are given in closed-form or with iterative solutions. Third, extensive experiments have been done to validate the proposed approach and its significant improvements over the BCPD. Note to Practitioners\u2014This paper was motivated by the problem of 3D rigid PSR for computer-assisted surgery (CAS), especially in orthopedic applications. The proposed algorithm is also suitable for other scenarios where the initial coarse registration is conducted. The traditional registration methods are susceptible to noise (especially anisotropic noise), outliers, and incomplete partial data. This paper generalizes the recently proposed BCPD method to the six-dimensional scenario where anisotropic positional noise is considered and normal vectors are incorporated. The proposed noise model is decomposed into three parts to be solved alternately: the membership probability of mixture distributions, the soft correspondence estimation, and the model parameters (i.e., the rotation matrix, translation vector, the covariance matrix with the anisotropic positional error, and the concentration parameter with the estimation of the normal vectors). Especially, the convergence is guaranteed at the theoretical level using the variational inference theory. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm on registration accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness to noise, outliers, and partial data.",

            "title": "A Non-autoregressive Multi-Horizon Flight Trajectory Prediction Framework with Gray Code Representation",
            "abstract": "Flight Trajectory Prediction (FTP) is an essential task in Air Traffic Control (ATC), which can assist air traffic controllers in managing airspace more safely and efficiently. Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.",

            "title": "Hybrid Indoor Positioning System Based on Acoustic Ranging and Wi-Fi Fingerprinting under NLOS Environments",
            "abstract": "An accurate indoor positioning system (IPS) for the public has become an essential function with the fast development of smart city-related applications. The performance of the current IPS is limited by the complex indoor environments, the poor performance of smartphone built-in sensors, and time-varying measurement errors of different location sources. This paper introduces a hybrid indoor positioning system (H-IPS) that combines acoustic ranging, Wi-Fi fingerprinting, and low-cost sensors. This system is designed specifically for large-scale indoor environments with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. To improve the accuracy in estimating pedestrian motion trajectory, a data and model dual-driven (DMDD) model is proposed to integrate the inertial navigation system (INS) mechanization and the deep learning-based speed estimator. Additionally, a double-weighted K-nearest neighbor matching algorithm enhanced the accuracy of Wi-Fi fingerprinting and scene recognition. The detected scene results were then utilized for NLOS detection and estimation of acoustic ranging results. Finally, an adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) was developed to provide universal positioning performance, which further improved by the Wi-Fi accuracy indicator and acoustic drift estimator. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented H-IPS achieves precise positioning under NLOS scenes, with meter-level accuracy attainable within the coverage range of acoustic signals.",

            "abstract": "Thermal issue is a major concern in 3D integrated circuit (IC) design. Thermal optimization of 3D IC often requires massive expensive PDE simulations. Neural network-based thermal prediction models can perform real-time prediction for many unseen new designs. However, existing works either solve 2D temperature fields only or do not generalize well to new designs with unseen design configurations (e.g., heat sources and boundary conditions). In this paper, for the first time, we propose DeepOHeat, a physics-aware operator learning framework to predict the temperature field of a family of heat equations with multiple parametric or non-parametric design configurations. This framework learns a functional map from the function space of multiple key PDE configurations (e.g., boundary conditions, power maps, heat transfer coefficients) to the function space of the corresponding solution (i.e., temperature fields), enabling fast thermal analysis and optimization by changing key design configurations (rather than just some parameters). We test DeepOHeat on some industrial design cases and compare it against Celsius 3D from Cadence Design Systems. Our results show that, for the unseen testing cases, a well-trained DeepOHeat can produce accurate results with 1000\u00d7 to 300000\u00d7 speedup.",

            "abstract": "One-class classification (OCC) is a longstanding method for anomaly detection. With the powerful representation capability of the pre-trained backbone, OCC methods have witnessed significant performance improvements. Typically, most of these OCC methods employ transfer learning to enhance the discriminative nature of the pre-trained backbone's features, thus achieving remarkable efficacy. While most current approaches emphasize feature transfer strategies, we argue that the optimization objective space within OCC methods could also be an underlying critical factor influencing performance. In this work, we conducted a thorough investigation into the optimization objective of OCC. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and derivation, we unveil a key insights: any space with the suitable norm can serve as an equivalent substitute for the hypersphere center, without relying on the distribution assumption of training samples. Further, we provide guidelines for determining the feasible domain of norms for the OCC optimization objective. This novel insight sparks a simple and data-agnostic deep one-class classification method. Our method is straightforward, with a single 1x1 convolutional layer as a trainable projector and any space with suitable norm as the optimization objective. Extensive experiments validate the reliability and efficacy of our findings and the corresponding methodology, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in both one-class classification and industrial vision anomaly detection and segmentation tasks.",

            "abstract": "The successful launching of more satellites in recent years has made data fusion an important and promising task because it can significantly increase the temporal frequency of the resulting time series data. To improve the usability of Gaofen-1 analysis ready data (GF1-ARD), Sentinel-2 (S2) is selected to enhance the temporal resolution of GF1-ARD due to their similar characteristics and short revisit period. Before constructing a denser time series from different platforms, bandpass alignment is required. Most researchers implement bandpass alignment using the linear model. However, the transformed bands of S2 by the linear model cannot match GF1-ARD well due to the limited globally shared parameters. In contrast, local-derived lookup tables (LUTs) can better address this problem. Inspired by the powerful capability of deep learning, we develop a model based on the U-shaped network (UNet) to learn tile-adaptive LUTs. Specifically, the LUTs are adaptively learned from the histogram of the S2 tile. Given that the bandpass alignment can be viewed as a histogram matching process, the expected LUTs are believed to be highly correlated with the input histogram. In addition, a simple convolutional module is further introduced to address the pixel-level misregistration. We have created a large-scale dataset and conducted extensive experiments on it to evaluate the competitive performance of the proposed model. Meanwhile, extensive visualizations are generated to illustrate the mechanism of our model. Furthermore, the temporal frequency of S2 and GF1-ARD is thoroughly assessed to demonstrate that bandpass alignment can significantly improve the temporal resolution of GF1-ARD.",

First, a new form of nonlinear MAS is presented by linear state transformation. Second, a state observer based on adaptive radial basis function neural networks is developed to estimate the unmeasured states. A command filter control scheme is deployed to address the problem of increased sharply complexity derived from the conventional backstepping design with the increase of the system order, and the filtered error is compensated by the error compensation mechanism. Third, by taking advantage of the Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functionals, a compensation control strategy is intended to exclude the impact of input delays. In addition, a Nussbaum-gain function is used to deal with the problem of uncertain control direction. An adaptive output feedback control approach is raised to construct the scaled consensus tracking control protocol, error compensating signals, and adaptive laws. It is proved that the tracking errors are driven to a small residual set, and all the signal variables are bounded in the closed-loop system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by two numerical simulations.",

            "abstract": "Optical tracking system (OTS) is an important part of surgical navigation and has been widely employed in clinical practice due to high accuracy and reliability. However, current OTS has a common occlusion of line-of-sight (LoS) problem. To address the partial occlusion problem of target, we propose a tracking-by-registration (TbR) method based on a novel grid-based target (GT) and a corresponding target generation algorithm (TGA). Based on the word probability and target distance metric, TGA generates a set of GTs to minimize ambiguity. Utilizing the prior information of model sets, the identification of different targets is realized during tracking. An infrared (IR) marker\u2019s performance is theoretically evaluated and the maximum angles within the feasible range are validated. Both simulations and experiments have been carried out to validate the feasibility and performance of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed approach has satisfactory performance to track the occluded target and provide a new option for optical tracking technologies.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, recommendation systems have already played a significant role in major streaming video platforms.The probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) model has advantages in addressing high-dimension problems and rating data sparsity in the recommendation system. However, in practical application, PMF has poor generalization ability and low prediction accuracy. For this reason, this article proposes the Hybrid AdaBoost Ensemble Method. Firstly, we use the membership function and the cluster center selection in fuzzy clustering to calculate the scoring matrix of the user-items. Secondly, the clustering user items\u2019 scoring matrix is trained by the neural network to improve the scoring prediction accuracy further. Finally, with the stability of the model, the AdaBoost integration method is introduced, and the score matrix is used as the base learner; then, the base learner is trained by different neural networks, and finally, the score prediction is obtained by voting results. In this article, we compare and analyze the performance of the proposed model on the MovieLens and FilmTrust datasets. In comparison with the PMF, FCM-PMF, Bagging-BP-PMF, and AdaBoost-SVM-PMF models, several experiments show that the mean absolute error of the proposed model increases by 1.24% and 0.79% compared with Bagging-BP-PMF model on two different datasets, and the root-mean-square error increases by 2.55% and 1.87% respectively. Finally, we introduce the weights of different neural network training based learners to improve the stability of the model\u2019s score prediction, which also proves the method\u2019s universality.",
