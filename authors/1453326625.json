            "title": "ESPP: Efficient Sector-Based Charging Scheduling and Path Planning for WRSNs With Hexagonal Topology",
            "abstract": "Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is a promising technology that can potentially mitigate the energy provisioning problem for sensor networks. In order to efficiently replenish energy for these battery-powered devices, designing appropriate scheduling and charging path planning algorithms is essential and challenging. Whilst previous studies have tackled this challenge, the conjoint influences of network topology, charging path planning, and energy threshold distribution in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) are still in their infancy. We mitigate the aforementioned problem by proposing novel algorithmic solutions to efficient sector-based on-demand charging scheduling and path planning. Specifically, we first propose a hexagonal cluster-based deployment of nodes such that finding an NP-Complete Hamiltonian path is feasible. Second, each cluster is divided into multiple sectors and a charging path planning algorithm is implemented to yield a Hamiltonian path, aimed at improving the Mobile Charging Vehicle (MCV) efficiency and charging throughput. Third, we propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the importance of nodes to be used for charging duration decision-making and prioritization. Fourth, a non-preemptive dynamic priority scheduling algorithm is proposed for charging tasks\u2019 assignments and scheduling. Finally, extensive simulations have been conducted, revealing the significant advantages of our proposed algorithms in terms of energy efficiency, response time, dead nodes\u2019 density, and queuing processing.",

            "abstract": "Cooking is one of the oldest and the most common human activities in everyone\u2019s daily life. Instructional cooking videos have also become one of the most common data sources for multimodal visual understanding researches. Compared to other domains, multimodal cooking videos: 1. not only have significantly stronger cross-modal dependencies between the speech transcriptions and their semantically-aligned visual frames at static time stamps; 2. but also have significantly stronger cross-context dependencies among the sequential steps along the temporal dimension, resulting as an ideal domain for contextualized semantic understanding. We propose Cooking-CLIP, which introduces the concept of language-image pretraining (CLIP) from a general-purpose multimodal embedding problem into a customized recipe generation application. We also propose a context-aware pretraining approach, to facilitate a better CLIP customization to cooking-related applications. Our approach achieves higher text generation accuracies than a strong zero-shot baseline on two instructional cooking video data sets, CrossTask and YouCook2. We also achieve comparative accuracies against a fully-supervised approach, with only a narrow difference, in spite of our zero-shot setting.",

            "abstract": "Control- and User-Plane Separation (CUPS) and Space Cellular Networks (SCNs) are promising solutions for delivering ubiquitous connectivity and high-traffic wireless services on a global scale. Nevertheless, the potential benefit of CUPS in the separation networks' coverage and data service functions has not been fully leveraged in enabling reliable connectivity. In this paper, we propose a CUPS-enabled Integrated Space-Ground Cellular Network (CUPS-ISGCN). Specifically, Control Base Stations (CBSs) are optimized by deploying them on the space layer to form the Control Plane (CP) and increase coverage for more users over a wide area. Meanwhile, Traffic Base Stations (TBSs) located on the ground layer form the User Plane (UP) and deliver high bit rates within the coverage area of the CP. To maximize CP coverage and improve UP efficiency, we introduce CUPS-enabled SCN into the CP and provide the analytical models to analyze the performance of the CUPS-ISGCN in terms of CP coverage and UP efficiency. By using stochastic geometry, we derive the general closed-form expressions for CP coverage. Then, we thoroughly study UP's performance as a function of the channel parameters between 2-planes, CP and UP. Based on the analysis results, it's proved that the proposed CUPS-ISGCN structure improved the CP coverage performance and UP efficiency.",

            "abstract": "In stratosphere cellular networks (SCNs) relying on control-and user-plane separation (CUPS), control base stations (CBSs) located on high altitude platforms (HAPs) form the control plane (CP) and provide control coverage for a large area on the ground. In contrast, traffic base stations (TBSs) on the ground forming the user plane (UP) are used for transmitting high-speed data under the blanket of the CP. To study the performance of SCN based on CUPS, especially CP\u2019s coverage, we present an analytical model in this paper. Based on stochastic geometry, we derive the CP\u2019s coverage probability under Rician fading, and UP\u2019s energy efficiency (UP-EE) under Rayleigh fading. Moreover, the letter is dependent on the successful coverage of CP. Numerical results show that when the traffic load is high, the CP\u2019s coverage probability increases with the increasing density of the CBSs. We also found that the maximal CP\u2019s coverage probability can be achieved by optimizing the height of the CBSs while achieving a high UP-EE within CP\u2019s coverage.",
