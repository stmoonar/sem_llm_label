            "abstract": "We present KnowEnG, a free-to-use computational system for analysis of genomics data sets, designed to accelerate biomedical discovery. It includes tools for popular bioinformatics tasks such as gene prioritization, sample clustering, gene set analysis and expression signature analysis. The system offers \u2018knowledge-guided\u2019 data-mining and machine learning algorithms, where user-provided data are analyzed in light of prior information about genes, aggregated from numerous knowledge-bases and encoded in a massive \u2018Knowledge Network\u2019. KnowEnG adheres to \u2018FAIR\u2019 principles: its tools are easily portable to diverse computing environments, run on the cloud for scalable and cost-effective execution of compute-intensive and data-intensive algorithms, and are interoperable with other computing platforms. They are made available through multiple access modes including a web-portal, and include specialized visualization modules. We present use cases and re-analysis of published cancer data sets using KnowEnG tools and demonstrate its potential value in democratization of advanced tools for the modern genomics era.",

            "abstract": "The existing organization of data structures for healthcare systems face difficulties as health care applications demand high speed storage and retrieval of data. This is due to the increasing number of parameters involved in algorithms corresponding to healthcare applications and the large amount of data generated by tests under every parameter. Hence, there is a need for a different type of data structures that is suitable for storage and retrieval of data related to healthcare applications. Hence, in this paper we propose a method for organizing data using a modified form of R-Trees namely mR-Trees. Conventional R-Trees deal with only static textual data. mR-Trees has been designed to support multi-dimensional dynamic numerical and textual data by using ranges at every node. Every node in the data structure is constrained to contain a fixed number of elements. If the number of elements exceeds the minimum bound, the ranges get split. This improves the complexity of the data structure from linear to logarithmic. The proposed data structure has been implemented in C++ and proved to be efficient compared to conventional data structures as they consume lesser access time.",

The number of web resources increases every day but the user is often unable to get the exact information due to the differ- ent page ranking techniques followed by individual Search Engines. Meta Search Engines solve this problem to a certain level by using more than one search engines. A Vertical Search Engine is used to provide the user with results for queries on a par- ticular domain such as Medical, Insurance and etc. This paper proposes three Multi Domain Meta Search Engines that facilitate efficient Information Retrieval on multiple domains. These Search En- gines combines the functionality of both the Meta Search Engine and the Vertical Search Engine. The Search Results of the Meta Search Engines are found to be better compared to usage of an individ- ual Search Engine.",

The blood cell counter data are subjected to a range test normally to ensure quality and then the tests are repeated manually to ensure correctness of the results. The manual procedure is time consuming and hence it is desired to reduce the number of manual reviews. A delta check is performed in some cases to reduce the number of manual reviews and that involves the previous test results of the same patient for the same test. This paper analyzes various ways of finding the delta values of the tests to reduce the number of manual reviews. Two exceptions to the process are also analyzed in this paper. The first case is to repeat the test even when the test result is normal and the second is not to go for retest even if the test results are abnormal based on the past results of the same patient.",
