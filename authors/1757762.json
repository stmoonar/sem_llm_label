            "abstract": "In this work, we address the following question. Suppose we are given a set D of positive-weighted disks and a set T of n points in the plane, such that each point of T is contained in at least two disks of D . Then is there always a subset S of D such that the union of the disks in S contains all the points of T and the total weight of the disks of D that are not in S is at least a constant fraction of the total weight of the disks in D ? In our work, we prove the Extraction Theorem that answers this question in the affirmative. Our constructive proof heavily exploits the geometry of disks, and in the process, we make interesting connections between our work and the literature on local search for geometric optimization problems. The Extraction Theorem helps to design the first polynomial-time O (1)-approximations for two important geometric covering problems involving disks.",

            "abstract": "In the Non-Uniform k -Center (NU k C) problem, a generalization of the famous k -center clustering problem, we want to cover the given set of points in a metric space by finding a placement of balls with specified radii. In t -NU k C, we assume that the number of distinct radii is equal to t , and we are allowed to use k i balls of radius r i , for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t . This problem was introduced by Chakrabarty et al. [ACM Trans. Alg. 16(4):46:1-46:19], who showed that a constant approximation for t -NU k C is not possible if t is unbounded, assuming P \u0338 = NP . On the other hand, they gave a bicriteria approximation that violates the number of allowed balls as well as the given radii by a constant factor. They also conjectured that a constant approximation for t -NU k C should be possible if t is a fixed constant. Since then, there has been steady progress towards resolving this conjecture \u2013 currently, a constant approximation for 3-NU k C is known via the results of Chakrabarty and Negahbani [IPCO 2021], and Jia et al. [SOSA 2022]. We push the horizon by giving an O (1)-approximation for the Non-Uniform k -Center for 4 distinct types of radii. Our result is obtained via a novel combination of tools and techniques from the k -center literature, which also demonstrates that the different generalizations of k -center involving non-uniform radii, and multiple coverage constraints (i.e., colorful k -center ), are closely interlinked with each other. We hope that our ideas will contribute towards a deeper understanding of the t -NU k C problem, eventually bringing us closer to the resolution of the CGK conjecture.",

In the capacitated version of the problem, we want to assign each point to a ball containing it, such that no ball is assigned more than U points, where U denotes the capacity of the points. While constant approximations are known for the uncapacitated version of the problem, there is no work on the capacitated version. We make progress on this problem by obtaining a constant approximation using a Fixed Parameter Tractable (FPT) algorithm. In particular, the running time of the algorithm is of the form 2 O ( k 2 ) \u00b7 n O (1) . As a warm-up for this result, we also give a constant approximation for the uncapacitated sum of radii clustering problem with matroid constraints, thus obtaining the \ufb01rst FPT approximation for this problem.",

The problem is known to be intractable and no sub-linear approximations are known even for simple obstacles such as rectangles and disks. The main result of our paper is an approximation framework that gives an O ( n \u03b1 ( n ) ) -approximation for polygonal obstacles, where \u03b1 ( n ) denotes the inverse Ackermann's function. For pseudodisks and rectilinear polygons, the same technique achieves an O ( n ) -approximation. The technique also gives O ( n ) -approximation for the minimum color path problem in graphs. We also present some inapproximability results for the geometric constraint removal problem.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we consider capacitated version of the set cover problem. We consider several metric and geometric versions of the capacitated set cover problem. In one such variant, the elements are points and the sets are the balls in a metric space. We also assume that the capacities of the input balls are monotonic -- for any two balls $B_i,B_j$ with radii $r_i$ and $r_j$, and capacities $U_i$ and $U_j$, respectively: $r_i > r_j$ implies that $U_i \\ge U_j$. We refer to this problem as the Metric Monotonic Capacitated Covering (MMCC) problem. We note that this assumption may be reasonable in many applications. Also this model generalizes the uniform capacity model. We also consider several variants of the MMCC problem. Unfortunately, MMCC remains as hard as the set cover problem even when the capacities are uniform, and thus we focus on obtaining \"bi-criteria\" approximations. In particular, we are allowed to expand the balls in our solution by some factor, but optimal solutions do not have that flexibility. \nOur main contribution is to design a unified algorithmic framework for obtaining bi-criteria constant approximations for several variants of the MMCC problem. Our framework is based on an iterative scheme based on LP rounding. As we show, only a constant $(\\le 9)$ factor expansion of the balls is sufficient to obtain constant approximations for all these variants. In fact, for Euclidean metric, only $(1+\\epsilon)$ factor expansion is sufficient for any $\\epsilon > 0$, where the approximation factor depends inversely on $\\epsilon$; whereas for a 1D variant, one can get a constant approximation without any expansion. We believe that the framework has the potential of obtaining similar approximations for many other capacitated covering problems. We also complement these bi-criteria approximations by showing hardness of approximation for some variants of the MMCC Problem.",

            "abstract": "We consider the following capacitated covering problem. We are given a set P of n points and a set $${\\mathcal {B}}$$ B of balls from some metric space, and a positive integer U that represents the capacity of each of the balls in $${\\mathcal {B}}$$ B . We would like to compute a subset $${\\mathcal {B}}' \\subseteq {\\mathcal {B}}$$ B \u2032 \u2286 B of balls and assign each point in P to some ball in $${\\mathcal {B}}'$$ B \u2032 that contains it, so that the number of points assigned to any ball is at most U . The objective function that we would like to minimize is the cardinality of $${\\mathcal {B}}'$$ B \u2032 . We consider this problem in arbitrary metric spaces as well as Euclidean spaces of constant dimension. In the metric setting, even the uncapacitated version of the problem is hard to approximate to within a logarithmic factor. In the Euclidean setting, the best known approximation guarantee in dimensions 3 and higher is logarithmic in the number of points. Thus we focus on obtaining \u201cbi-criteria\u201d approximations. In particular, we are allowed to expand the balls in our solution by some factor, but optimal solutions do not have that flexibility. Our main result is that allowing constant factor expansion of the input balls suffices to obtain constant approximations for this problem. In fact, in the Euclidean setting, only $$1+\\epsilon $$ 1 + \u03f5 factor expansion is sufficient for any $$\\epsilon > 0$$ \u03f5 > 0 , with the approximation factor being a polynomial in $$1/\\epsilon $$ 1 / \u03f5 . We obtain these results using a unified scheme for rounding the natural LP relaxation; this scheme may be useful for other capacitated covering problems. We also complement these bi-criteria approximations by obtaining hardness of approximation results that shed light on our understanding of these problems.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we consider two metric covering/clustering problems - \\textit{Minimum Cost Covering Problem} (MCC) and $k$-clustering. In the MCC problem, we are given two point sets $X$ (clients) and $Y$ (servers), and a metric on $X \\cup Y$. We would like to cover the clients by balls centered at the servers. The objective function to minimize is the sum of the $\\alpha$-th power of the radii of the balls. Here $\\alpha \\geq 1$ is a parameter of the problem (but not of a problem instance). MCC is closely related to the $k$-clustering problem. The main difference between $k$-clustering and MCC is that in $k$-clustering one needs to select $k$ balls to cover the clients. \nFor any $\\eps > 0$, we describe quasi-polynomial time $(1 + \\eps)$ approximation algorithms for both of the problems. However, in case of $k$-clustering the algorithm uses $(1 + \\eps)k$ balls. Prior to our work, a $3^{\\alpha}$ and a ${c}^{\\alpha}$ approximation were achieved by polynomial-time algorithms for MCC and $k$-clustering, respectively, where $c > 1$ is an absolute constant. These two problems are thus interesting examples of metric covering/clustering problems that admit $(1 + \\eps)$-approximation (using $(1+\\eps)k$ balls in case of $k$-clustering), if one is willing to settle for quasi-polynomial time. In contrast, for the variant of MCC where $\\alpha$ is part of the input, we show under standard assumptions that no polynomial time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor better than $O(\\log |X|)$ for $\\alpha \\geq \\log |X|$.",

            "abstract": "\\textit{Clustering problems} often arise in the fields like data mining, machine learning etc. to group a collection of objects into similar groups with respect to a similarity (or dissimilarity) measure. Among the clustering problems, specifically \\textit{$k$-means} clustering has got much attention from the researchers. Despite the fact that $k$-means is a very well studied problem its status in the plane is still an open problem. In particular, it is unknown whether it admits a PTAS in the plane. The best known approximation bound in polynomial time is $9+\\eps$. \nIn this paper, we consider the following variant of $k$-means. Given a set $C$ of points in $\\mathcal{R}^d$ and a real $f > 0$, find a finite set $F$ of points in $\\mathcal{R}^d$ that minimizes the quantity $f*|F|+\\sum_{p\\in C} \\min_{q \\in F} {||p-q||}^2$. For any fixed dimension $d$, we design a local search PTAS for this problem. We also give a \"bi-criterion\" local search algorithm for $k$-means which uses $(1+\\eps)k$ centers and yields a solution whose cost is at most $(1+\\eps)$ times the cost of an optimal $k$-means solution. The algorithm runs in polynomial time for any fixed dimension. \nThe contribution of this paper is two fold. On the one hand, we are being able to handle the square of distances in an elegant manner, which yields near optimal approximation bound. This leads us towards a better understanding of the $k$-means problem. On the other hand, our analysis of local search might also be useful for other geometric problems. This is important considering that very little is known about the local search method for geometric approximation.",

            "abstract": "Recently, Adamaszek and Wiese [1, 2] presented a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme (QPTAS) for the problem of computing a maximum weight independent set for certain families of planar objects. This major advance on the problem was based on their proof that a certain type of separator exists for any independent set. Subsequently, Har-Peled [22] simplified and generalized their result. Mustafa et al. [36] also described a simplification, and somewhat surprisingly, showed that QPTAS's can be obtained for certain, albeit special, type of covering problems. \n \nBuilding on these developments, we revisit two NP-hard geometric partitioning problems -- convex decomposition and surface approximation. Partitioning problems combine the features of packing and covering. In particular, since the optimal solution does form a packing, the separator theorems are potentially applicable. Nevertheless, the two partitioning problems we study bring up additional difficulties that are worth examining in the context of the wider applicability of the separator methodology. We show how these issues can be handled in presenting quasi-polynomial time algorithms for these two problems with improved approximation guarantees.",

We present two approximation algorithms for the case where the points live in a d-dimensional Hamming space. Our algorithms guarantee query times that are sub-linear in n and only polynomial in the diversity parameter k, as well as the dimension d. For low values of k, our algorithms achieve sub-linear query times even if the number of points within distance r from a query $q$ is linear in $n$.

Observe that this is a shape fitting problem where we wish to find the best fit in the L1 sense. Here we will treat the number j of subspaces we want to fit and the dimension k of each of them as constants. We consider instances of projective clustering where the point coordinates are integers of magnitude polynomial in m and n. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that for any e > 0 runs in time O(mn polylog(mn)) and outputs a solution that with high probability is within (1 + e) of the optimal solution. \n \nTo obtain this result, we show that the fixed dimensional version of the above projective clustering problem has a small coreset. We do that by observing that in a fairly general sense, shape fitting problems that have small coresets in the L\u221e setting also have small coresets in the L1 setting, and then exploiting an existing construction for the L\u221e setting. This observation seems to be quite useful for other shape fitting problems as well, as we demonstrate by constructing the first \"regular\" coreset for the circle fitting problem in the plane.",

            "abstract": "Given a graph <i>G</i> = (<i>V, E</i>) and positive integral vertex weights <i>w</i>: <i>V</i> \u2192 <b>N</b>, the <i>max-coloring problem</i> seeks to find a proper vertex coloring of <i>G</i> whose color classes <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, &ldots;, C<sub><i>k</i></sub>, minimize \u2211<sub><i>i</i></sub>=1<sup><i>k</i></sup> max<sub><i>v</i></sub> \u2208 <i>C</i><sup><i>i</i></sup> <i>w</i>(<i>v</i>). This problem, restricted to interval graphs, arises whenever there is a need to design dedicated memory managers that provide better performance than the general-purpose memory management of the operating system.\n Though this problem seems similar to the dynamic storage allocation problem, there are fundamental differences. We make a connection between max-coloring and online graph coloring and use this to devise a simple 2-approximation algorithm for max-coloring on interval graphs. We also show that a simple first-fit strategy, that is a natural choice for this problem, yields an 8-approximation algorithm. We show this result by proving that the first-fit algorithm for online coloring an interval graph <i>G</i> uses no more than 8 \u010b \u03c7(<i>G</i>) colors, significantly improving the bound of 26 \u010b \u03c7(<i>G</i>) by Kierstead and Qin [1995]. We also show that the max-coloring problem is NP-hard.\n The problem of online coloring of intervals with bandwidths is a simultaneous generalization of online interval coloring and online bin packing. The input is a set <i>I</i> of intervals, each interval <i>i</i>\u2208 <i>I</i> having an associated <i>bandwidth</i> <i>b</i>(<i>i</i>) \u2208 (0, 1]. We seek an online algorithm that produces a coloring of the intervals such that for any color <i>c</i> and any real <i>r</i>, the sum of the bandwidths of intervals containing <i>r</i> and colored <i>c</i> is at most 1. Motivated by resource allocation problems, Adamy and Erlebach [2003] consider this problem and present an algorithm that uses at most 195 times the number of colors used by an optimal offline algorithm. Using the new analysis of first-fit coloring of interval graphs, we show that the Adamy-Erlebach algorithm is 35-competitive. Finally, we generalize the Adamy-Erlebach algorithm to a class of algorithms and show that a different instance from this class is 30-competitive.",

            "abstract": "We consider the following combinatorial problem: given a set of n objects (for example, disks in the plane, triangles), and an integer L \u2265 1, what is the size of the smallest subset of these n objects that covers all points that are in at least L of the objects? This is the classic question about the size of an L/n-net for these objects. It is well known that for fairly general classes of geometric objects the size of an L/n-net is O(n/L log n/L). There are some instances where this general bound can be improved, and this improvement is usually due to bounds on the combinatorial complexity (size) of the boundary of the union of these objects. Thus, the boundary of the union of m disks has size O(m), and this translates to an O(n/L) bound on the size of an L/n-net for disks. For m fat triangles, the size of the union boundary is O(m log log m), and this yields L/n-nets of size O(n/L log log n/L). Improved nets directly translate into an upper bound on the ratio between the optimal integral solution and the optimal fractional solution for the corresponding geometric set cover problem. Thus, for covering k points by disks, this ratio is O(1); and for covering k points by fat triangles, this ratio is O(log log k). This connection to approximation algorithms for geometric set cover is a major motivation for attempting to improve bounds on nets. Our main result is an argument that in some cases yields nets that are smaller than those previously obtained from the size of the union boundary. Thus for fat triangles, for instance, we obtain nets of size O(n/L log log log n). We use this to obtain a randomized polynomial time algorithm that gives an O(log log log k)-approximation for the problem of covering k points by the smallest subset of a given set of triangles.",

We are then interested in forming $n$ camera pairs where each camera belongs to exactly one pair, followed by forming a matching between the targets and camera pairs so as to best estimate the locations of each of the targets. We consider a special case of this problem where each of the cameras are placed along a horizontal line $l$, and we consider two objective functions which have been shown to give good estimates of the locations of the targets when the distances between the targets and the cameras are sufficiently large. In the first objective, the value of an assignment of a camera pair to a target is the tracking angle formed by the assignment. Here, we are interested in maximizing the sum of these tracking angles. A polynomial time 2-approximation is known for this problem. We give a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that returns a solution whose value is at least a $(1-\\epsilon)$ factor of the value of an optimal solution for any $\\epsilon > 0$. In the second objective, the cost of an assignment of a camera pair to a target is the ratio of the vertical distance between the target and $l$ to the horizontal distance between the cameras in the camera pair. In this setting, we are interested in minimizing the sum of these ratios. A polynomial time 2-approximation is known for this problem. We give a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that returns a solution whose value is at most a $(1+\\epsilon)$ factor of the value of an optimal solution for any $\\epsilon > 0$.",

            "abstract": "Over the last few years, the problem of computing market equilibrium prices for exchange economies has received much attention in the theoretical computer science community. Such activity led to a flurry of polynomial time algorithms for various restricted, yet significant, settings. The most important restrictions arise either when the traders' utility functions satisfy a property known as gross substitutability or when the initial endowments are proportional (the Fisher model). In this paper, we experimentally compare the performance of some of these recent algorithms against that of the most used software packages. In particular, we evaluate the following approaches: (1) the solver PATH, available under GAMS/MPSGE, a popular tool for computing market equilibrium prices; (2) a discrete version of a simple iterative price update scheme called t\u00e2tonnement; (3) a discrete version of the welfare adjustment process; (4) convex feasibility programs that characterize the equilibrium in some special cases. We analyze the performance of these approaches on models of exchange economies where the consumers are equipped with utility functions, which are widely used in real world applications. The outcomes of our experiments consistently show that many market settings allow for an efficient computation of the equilibrium, well beyond the restrictions under which the theory provides polynomial time guarantees. For some of the approaches, we also identify models where they are are prone to failure.",

            "abstract": "We show that for any class of bipartite graphs which is closed under edge deletion and where the number of perfect matchings can be counted in NC, there is a deterministic NC algorithm for finding a perfect matching. In particular, a perfect matching can be found in NC for planar bipartite graphs and K3,3-free bipartite graphs via this approach. A crucial ingredient is part of an interior-point algorithm due to Goldberg, Plotkin, Shmoys and Tardos. An easy observation allows this approach to handle regular bipartite graphs as well. We show, by a careful analysis of the polynomial time algorithm due to Galluccio and Loebl, that the number of perfect matchings in a graph of small (O(log n)) genus can be counted in NC. So perfect matchings in small genus bipartite graphs can also be found via this approach. We then present a different algorithm for finding a perfect matching in a planar bipartite graph. This algorithm is substantially different from the algorithm described above, and also from the algorithm of Miller and Naor, which predates the approach of Goldberg et al. and tackles the same problem. Our new algorithm extends to small genus bipartite graphs, but not to K3,3-free bipartite graphs. We next show that a non-trivial extension of this algorithm allows us to compute a vertex of the fractional perfect matching polytope (such a vertex is either a perfect matching or a half-integral matching) in NC, provided the graph is planar or small genus but not necessarily bipartite, and has a perfect matching to begin with. This extension rekindles the hope for an NC-algorithm to find a perfect matching in a non-bipartite planar graph. \ufffd Most results in this paper were originally announced in papers in Proc. 32nd ACM Symposium on Theory of",

            "abstract": "We consider the problem of computing the outer-radii of point sets. In this problem, we are given integers $n, d$, and $k$, where $k \\le d$, and a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\\Re^d$. The goal is to compute the outer $k$-radius of $P$, denoted by ${\\cal R}_k(P)$, which is the minimum over all $(d-k)$-dimensional flats $F$ of $\\max_{p \\in P} d(p,F)$, where $d(p,F)$ is the Euclidean distance between the point $p$ and flat $F$. Computing the radii of point sets is a fundamental problem in computational convexity with many significant applications. The problem admits a polynomial time algorithm when the dimension $d$ is constant [U. Faigle, W. Kern, and M. Streng, Math. Program., 73 (1996), pp. 1-5]. Here we are interested in the general case in which the dimension $d$ is not fixed and can be as large as $n$, where the problem becomes NP-hard even for $k=1$. It is known that $R_k(P)$ can be approximated in polynomial time by a factor of $(1 + \\varepsilon)$ for any $\\varepsilon > 0$ when $d - k$ is a fixed constant [M. Babdoiu, S. Har-Peled, and P. Indyk, in Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing, 2002; S. Har-Peled and K. Varadarajan, in Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Computing Geometry, 2002]. A polynomial time algorithm that guarantees a factor of $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ approximation for $R_1(P)$, the width of the point set $P$, is implied by the results of Nemirovski, Roos, and Terlaky [Math. Program., 86 (1999), pp. 463-473] and Nesterov [Handbook of Semidefinite Programming Theory, Algorithms, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA, 2000]. In this paper, we show that $R_k(P)$ can be approximated by a ratio of $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ for any $1 \\leq k \\leq d$, thus matching the previously best known ratio for approximating the special case $R_1 (P)$, the width of point set $P$. Our algorithm is based on semidefinite programming relaxation with a new mixed deterministic and randomized rounding procedure. We also prove an inapproximability result that gives evidence that our approximation algorithm is doing well for a large range of $k$. We show that there exists a constant $\\delta > 0$ such that the following holds for any $0 < \\eps < 1$: there is no polynomial time algorithm that approximates $R_k(P)$ within $(\\log n)^{\\delta}$ for all $k$ such that $k \\leq d - d^{\\varepsilon}$ unless NP $\\subseteq$ DTIME $[2^{(\\log m)^{O(1)}}]$. Our inapproximability result for $R_k(P)$ extends a previously known hardness result of Brieden [Discrete Comput. Geom., 28 (2002), pp. 201-209] and is proved by modifying Brieden\u2019s construction using basic ideas from probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP) theory.",

In the constant returns model, each producer has a convex, constant-returns-to-scale, technology. In particular, this means that if the technology can output a certain quantity of a good using as input certain quantities of other goods, then scaling all these quantities by a common, non-negative, number also results in a technologically feasible plan. The technology also accomodates the no-free-lunch property, which says that it is not possible to produce something from nothing. At a given price, the producer picks a technologically feasible plan that maximizes her profit. Associated with each consumer is an initial endowment of goods and a utility function that describes her preferences between various bundles of goods. At a given price, the consumer sells her initial endowment, thus obtaining a certain income, and demands the bundle of goods maximizing her utility among all bundles that she can afford at the given price with her income.",

Unlike bimatrix games, such economies are not guaranteed to have equilibria in general. On the other hand, they include suitable restricted versions which always have equilibria.We give a reduction from two-player games to a special family of Leontief exchange economies, which are guaranteed to have equilibria, with the property that the Nash equilibria of any game are in one-to-one correspondence with the equilibria of the corresponding economy.Our reduction exposes a potential hurdle inherent in solving certain families of market equilibrium problems: finding an equilibrium for Leontief economies (where an equilibrium is guaranteed to exist) is at least as hard as finding a Nash equilibrium for two-player nonzero sum games.As a corollary of the one-to-one correspondence, we obtain a number of hardness results for questions related to the computation of market equilibria, using results already established for games [17]. In particular, among other results, we show that it is NP-hard to say whether a particular family of Leontief exchange economies, that is guaranteed to have at least one equilibrium, has more than one equilibrium.Perhaps more importantly, we also prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether a Leontief exchange economy has an equilibrium. This fact should be contrasted against the known PPAD-completeness result of [30], which holds when the problem satisfies some standard sufficient conditions that make it equivalent to the computational version of Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem.On the algorithmic side, we present an algorithm for finding an approximate equilibrium for some special Leontief economies, which achieves quasi-polynomial time whenever each trader does not demand too much more of any good than some other good.",

            "abstract": "The problem of computing equilibria for exchange economies has recently started to receive a great deal of attention in the theoretical computer science community. It has been shown that equilibria can be computed in polynomial time in various special cases, the most important of which are when traders have linear, Cobb-Douglas, or a range of CES utility functions. These important special cases are instances when the market satisfies a property called weak gross substitutability. Classical results in economics, which theoretical computer scientists (including us) appear to have been hitherto unaware of, show that the equilibrium prices in such markets are characterized by an infinite number of linear inequalities and therefore form a convex set. In this paper, we show that under fairly general assumptions, there are polynomial-time algorithms to compute equilibria in such markets. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first polynomial-time algorithms for exchange markets under the general setting of weak gross substitutability. To show this result, we need to build on the proofs that characterize the equilibria as a convex set.As a consequence, we obtain alternative polynomial-time algorithms for computing equilibria with linear, Cobb-Douglas, a range of CES, as well as certain other non-homogeneous utility functions that satisfy weak gross substitutability. Unlike previous polynomial-time algorithms, our approach does not make use of the specific form of these utility functions and is in this sense more general. We expect our framework to work or be readily adaptable to handle other exchange markets, provided that the utility functions satisfy weak gross substitutability.",

In 1954, Nobel laureates Arrow and Debreu proved the existence of an equilibrium under milder assumptions [3].

The First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare showed the Pareto optimality of allocations at equilibrium prices, thereby formally expressing Adam Smith\u2019s \u201cinvisible hand\u201d property of markets and providing important social justification for the theory of equilibrium.

This problem, restricted to interval graphs, arises whenever there is a need to design dedicated memory managers that provide better performance than the general purpose memory management of the operating system. Specifically, companies have tried to solve this problem in the design of memory managers for wireless protocol stacks such as GPRS or 3G.Though this problem seems similar to the wellknown dynamic storage allocation problem, we point out fundamental differences. We make a connection between max-coloring and on-line graph coloring and use this to devise a simple 2-approximation algorithm for max-coloring on interval graphs. We also show that a simple first-fit strategy, that is a natural choice for this problem, yields a 10-approximation algorithm. We show this result by proving that the first-fit algorithm for on-line coloring an interval graph <i>G</i> uses no more than 10.<i>x</i>(<i>G</i>) colors, significantly improving the bound of 26.<i>x</i>(<i>G</i>) by Kierstead and Qin (<i>Discrete Math.</i>, 144, 1995).

In 1936, Wald gave the first proof of the existence of an equilibrium for the Walrasian system, albeit under severe restrictions [61]. In 1954, Nobel laureates Arrow and Debreu proved the existence of an equilibrium under milder assumptions [3]. This existence result, along with the two fundamental theorems of welfare are the pillars of modern equilibrium theory. The First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare showed the Pareto optimality of allocations at equilibrium prices, thereby formally expressing Adam Smith's \"invisible hand\" property of markets and providing important social justification for the theory of equilibrium.",

We consider the scenario when the dimension d is not fixed and can be as large as n. Computing the various radii of point sets is a fundamental problem in computational convexity with many applications. The main result of this paper is a randomized polynomial time algorithm that approximates Rk (P) to within a factor of O/spl radic/(log n/spl middot/log d) for any 1/spl les/k/spl les/d. This algorithm is obtained using techniques from semidefinite programming and dimension reduction. Previously, good approximation algorithms were known only for the case k=1 and for the case when k=d-c for any constant c; there are polynomial time algorithms that approximate Rk(P) to within a factor of (1+/spl epsi/), for any /spl epsi/>0, when d-k is any fixed constant. On the other hand, some results from the mathematical programming community on approximating certain kinds of quadratic programs imply an O/spl radic/(log n) approximation for R/sub 1/ (P), the width of the point set P. We also prove an inapproximability result for computing Rk (P), which easily yields the conclusion that our approximation algorithm performs quite well for a large range of values of k. Our inapproximability result for Rk (P) improves the previous known hardness result of Brieden, and is proved by improving the parameters in Brieden's construction using basic ideas from PCP theory.",

            "abstract": "I t has been known for a long t ime now tha t the problem of counting the number of perfect matchings in a planar graph is in NC. This result is based on the notion of a pfaffian orientation of a graph. (Recently, Galluccio and Loebl [7] gave a P-t ime algorithm for the case of graphs of small genus.) However, it is not known if the corresponding search problem, tha t of finding one perfect matching in a planar graph, is in NC. This situation is intriguing as it seems to contradict our intuit ion tha t search should be easier than counting. For the case of planar bipartite graphs, Miller and Naor [22] showed tha t a perfect matching can indeed be found using an NC algorithm. We present a very different NG-algorithm for this problem. Unlike the Miller-Naor algorithm, our approach directly uses the fact tha t counting is in NC, and it also generalizes to the problem of finding a perfect matching in a bipar t i te graph of small (O(log n)) genus. I t also rekindles the hope for an NC-algorithm to find a perfect matching in a non-bipart i te planar graph. Along the way, we modify the algorithm of Gallucio and Loebl [7] to show that counting the number of perfect matchings in graphs of small genus is in NC.",

            "abstract": "For a polyhedral terrain C, the contour at z-coordinate h, denoted Ch, is defined to be the intersection of the plane z = h with C. In this paper, we study the contour-line extraction problem, where we want to preprocess C into a data structure so that given a query z-coordinate h, we can report Ch quickly. This is a central problem that arises in geographic information systems (GIS), where terrains are often stored as Triangular Irregular Networks (TINS). We present an I/O-optimal algorithm for this problem which stores a terrain C with N vertices using O(N/B) blocks, where B is the size of a disk block, so that for any query h, the contour ch can be computed using o(log, N + I&l/B) I/O operations, where l&l denotes the size of Ch. We also present en improved algorithm for a more general problem of blocking bounded-degree planar graphs such as TINS (i.e., storing them on disk so that any graph traversal algorithm can traverse the graph in an I/O-efficient manner), and apply it to two problms that arise in GIS. *Supported in part by National Science Foundation research grant CCR-93-01259, by Army Research Office MURI grant DAAH04-96-1-0013, by a Sloan fellowship, by a National Science Foundation NY1 award and matching funds from Xerox Corporation, and by a grant from the U.S.-Israeli Binational Science Foundation.

We present an O(n/sup 3/2/log/sup 5/ n)-time algorithm for computing a min-cost perfect matching in the plane, which is an improvement over the previous best algorithm of Vaidya [1989) by nearly a factor of n. Vaidya's algorithm is an implementation of the algorithm of Edmonds (1965), which runs in n phases, and computes a matching with i edges at the end of the i-th phase. Vaidya shows that geometry can be exploited to implement a single phase in roughly O(n/sup 3/2/) time, thus obtaining an O(n/sup 5/2/log/sup 4/ n)-time algorithm. We improve upon this in two major ways. First, we develop a variant of Edmonds algorithm that uses geometric divide-and-conquer, so that in the conquer step we need only O(/spl radic/n) phases. Second, we show that a single phase can be implemented in O(n log/sup 5/ n) time.",

The goal is to minimize the number of vertices needed in the approximation C\u2019. We use the uniform metric as the error criterion for the approximation. We consider two problems. (1) Given e ? O, find an approximation, among all approximations whose error is at most e. that has the smallest number of vertices. We give an 0(n4f3+6 )time algorithm to solve this problem; throughout this paper, d > 0 is an arbitrarily small constant, and the constant of proportionality hidden in the big-Oh notation depends on 6. (2) Given an integer k, find an approximation with at most k vertices whose error is the smallest among all approximations with at most k vertices. We give a simple randomized algorithm, with expected running time 0(n413+d), to solve this problem. We also present a deterministic version of the algorithm that has the same asymptotic time complexity. Algorithms with close to linear running times are known for the variants of this problem which do not restrict the vertices of the approximation C\u2019 to be a subset of the set of vertices of C.
