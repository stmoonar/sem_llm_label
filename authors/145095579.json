            "abstract": "Competitive sports coverage increasingly includes information on athlete or team statistics and records. Sports video coverage has traditionally embedded representations of this data in fixed locations on the screen, but more recently also attached representations to athletes or other targets in motion. These publicly used representations so far have been rather simple and systematic investigations of the research space of embedded visualizations in motion are still missing. Here we report on our preliminary research in the domain of professional and amateur swimming. We analyzed how visualizations are currently added to the coverage of Olympics swimming competitions and then plan to derive a design space for embedded data representations for swimming competitions. We are currently conducting a crowdsourced survey to explore which kind of swimming-related data general audiences are interested in, in order to identify opportunities for additional visualizations to be added to swimming competition coverage.",

            "abstract": "Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are becoming increasingly popular as a shape memory material for soft robot actuators that operate in a contractile or flexural mode. There have been previously studies on the use of LCEs for reversible changes in surface topography. However, surface protrusions have typically been limited to the order of 1\u2009\u03bcm or depend on light, heat, or electrical stimulation that are difficult to locally control or require relatively high voltage. This article presents a novel operation mode of LCE actuators based on the wrinkling behavior of an LCE\u2010elastomer bilayer architecture. Embedding a liquid\u2010metal\u2010based conductive ink within the LCE enables electrical control of surface wrinkling through Joule heating. The actuator cells can generate wrinkles with amplitudes ranging from 17 to 45\u2009\u03bcm within 30\u2009s under an input power of 2\u2009W and a voltage on the order of 1\u2009V. As the bilayer is composed entirely of soft materials, it is highly deformable, flexible, and can be integrated into a multi\u2010cell array capable of bending on curved surfaces.",

            "abstract": "Smart shape-changing materials can be adapted to different usages, which have been leveraged for dynamic affordances and on-demand haptic feedback in HCI. However, the applicability of these materials is often bottlenecked by their complex fabrication and the challenge of programming localized and individually addressable responses. In this work, we propose a toolkit for designing and fabricating programmable morphing objects using off-the-shelf epoxies. Our method involves varying the crosslinker to epoxy resin ratio to control morphing temperatures from 40 \u2103 to 90 \u2103, either across different regions of a shape memory device or across devices. Functional components (e.g., conductive fabric, magnetic particles) are also incorporated with the epoxy for sensing and active reconfiguration. A toolbox of fabrication methods and a primitive design library are introduced to support design ideation and programmable morphing. Finally, we demonstrate application examples, including morphing toys, a shape-changing input device, and an active window shutter.",

In material processes, \u201cgrain\u201d describes underlying physical properties like the orientation of cellulose fibers in wood that, in aggregate, affect fabrication concerns (such as directional cutting) and outcomes (such as axes of strength and visual effects). Extending this into the realm of computational fabrication, grain spaces define a curated set of mid-level material properties as well as the underlying low-level fabrication processes needed to produce them.

            "abstract": "Open-World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (OW-CZSL) aims to recognize new compositions of seen attributes and objects. In OW-CZSL, methods built on the conventional closed-world setting degrade severely due to the unconstrained OW test space. While previous works alleviate the issue by pruning compositions according to external knowledge or correlations in seen pairs, they introduce biases that harm the generalization. Some methods thus predict state and object with independently constructed and trained classifiers, ignoring that attributes are highly context-dependent and visually entangled with objects. In this paper, we propose a novel Distilled Reverse Attention Network to address the challenges. We also model attributes and objects separately but with different motivations, capturing contextuality and locality, respectively. We further design a reverse-and-distill strategy that learns disentangled representations of elementary components in training data supervised by reverse attention and knowledge distillation. We conduct experiments on three datasets and consistently achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.",

            "abstract": "Recent developments in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enabled the myriad emergence of a plethora of data-intensive and latency-sensitive vehicular applications, posing significant difficulties to traditional cloud computing. Vehicular edge computing (VEC), as an emerging paradigm, enables the vehicles to utilize the resources of the edge servers to reduce the data transfer burden and computing stress. Although the utilization of VEC is a favourable support for IoV applications, vehicle mobility and other factors further complicate the challenge of designing and implementing such systems, leading to incremental delay and energy consumption. In recent times, there have been attempts to integrate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches with IoV-based systems, to facilitate real-time decision-making and prediction. We demonstrate the potential of such an approach in this paper. Specifically, the dynamic computation offloading problem is constructed as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm is utilized to achieve the optimal offloading strategy. Finally, findings from the simulation demonstrate the potential of our proposed approach.",

            "title": "Dual Contrastive Transformer for Hierarchical Preference Modeling in Sequential Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) aim to predict the subsequent items which may interest users via comprehensively modeling users' complex preference embedded in the sequence of user-item interactions. However, most of existing SRSs often model users' single low-level preference based on item ID information while ignoring the high-level preference revealed by item attribute information, such as item category. Furthermore, they often utilize limited sequence context information to predict the next item while overlooking richer inter-item semantic relations. To this end, in this paper, we proposed a novel hierarchical preference modeling framework to substantially model the complex low- and high-level preference dynamics for accurate sequential recommendation. Specifically, in the framework, a novel dual-transformer module and a novel dual contrastive learning scheme have been designed to discriminatively learn users' low- and high-level preference and to effectively enhance both low- and high-level preference learning respectively. In addition, a novel semantics-enhanced context embedding module has been devised to generate more informative context embedding for further improving the recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets have demonstrated both the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art ones and the rationality of our design.",
