            "title": "Profit Optimization in Spatial Crowdsourcing: Effectiveness and Efficiency",
            "abstract": "In Spatial crowdsourcing, mobile users perform spatio-temporal tasks that involve travel to specified locations. Spatial crowdsourcing (SC) is enabled by SC platforms that support mobile worker recruitment and retention, as well as task assignment, which is essential to maximize profits that are accrued from serving task requests. Specifically, how to best achieve task assignment in a cost-effective manner while contending with spatio-temporal constraints is a key challenge in SC. To address this challenge, we formalize and study a novel Profit-driven Task Assignment problem. We first establish a task reward pricing model that takes into account the temporal constraints (i.e., expected completion time and deadline) of tasks. Then we adopt an optimal algorithm based on tree decomposition to achieve an optimal task assignment and propose greedy algorithms based on Random Tuning Optimization to improve the computational efficiency. To balance effectiveness and efficiency, we also provide a heuristic task assignment algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization that assigns tasks by simulating behavior of ant colonies foraging for food. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using real and synthetic data, offering detailed insight into effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.",

            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Correlated time series (CTS) forecasting plays an essential role in many practical applications, such as traffic management and server load control. Many deep learning models have been proposed to improve the accuracy of CTS forecasting. However, while models have become increasingly complex and computationally intensive, they struggle to improve accuracy. Pursuing a different direction, this study aims instead to enable much more efficient, lightweight models that preserve accuracy while being able to be deployed on resource-constrained devices. To achieve this goal, we characterize popular CTS forecasting models and yield two observations that indicate directions for lightweight CTS forecasting. On this basis, we propose the LightCTS framework that adopts plain stacking of temporal and spatial operators instead of alternate stacking that is much more computationally expensive. Moreover, LightCTS features light temporal and spatial operator modules, called L-TCN and GL-Former, that offer improved computational efficiency without compromising their feature extraction capabilities. LightCTS also encompasses a last-shot compression scheme to reduce redundant temporal features and speed up subsequent computations. Experiments with single-step and multi-step forecasting benchmark datasets show that LightCTS is capable of nearly state-of-the-art accuracy at much reduced computational and storage overheads.",

            "abstract": "The continued digitization of societal processes translates into a proliferation of time series data that cover applications such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, and energy management, where anomaly detection is often essential to enable reliability and safety. Many recent studies target anomaly detection for time series data. Indeed, area of time series anomaly detection is characterized by diverse data, methods, and evaluation strategies, and comparisons in existing studies consider only part of this diversity, which makes it difficult to select the best method for a particular problem setting. To address this shortcoming, we introduce taxonomies for data, methods, and evaluation strategies, provide a comprehensive overview of unsupervised time series anomaly detection using the taxonomies, and systematically evaluate and compare state-of-the-art traditional as well as deep learning techniques. In the empirical study using nine publicly available datasets, we apply the most commonly-used performance evaluation metrics to typical methods under a fair implementation standard. Based on the structuring offered by the taxonomies, we report on empirical studies and provide guidelines, in the form of comparative tables, for choosing the methods most suitable for particular application settings. Finally, we propose research directions for this dynamic field.",

            "abstract": "Crowdsourcing aims to enable the assignment of available resources to the completion of tasks at scale. The continued digitization of societal processes translates into increased opportunities for crowdsourcing. For example, crowdsourcing enables the assignment of computational resources of humans, called workers, to tasks that are notoriously hard for computers. In settings faced with malicious actors, detection of such actors holds the potential to increase the robustness of crowdsourcing platform. We propose a framework called Outlier Detection for Streaming Task Assignment that aims to improve robustness by detecting malicious actors. In particular, we model the arrival of workers and the submission of tasks as evolving time series and provide means of detecting malicious actors by means of outlier detection. We propose a novel socially aware Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based architecture that is capable of contending with the complex distributions found in time series. The architecture includes two GANs that are designed to adversarially train an autoencoder to learn the patterns of distributions in worker and task time series, thus enabling outlier detection based on reconstruction errors. A GAN structure encompasses a game between a generator and a discriminator, where it is desirable that the two can learn to coordinate towards socially optimal outcomes, while avoiding being exploited by selfish opponents. To this end, we propose a novel training approach that incorporates social awareness into the loss functions of the two GANs. Additionally, to improve task assignment efficiency, we propose an efficient greedy algorithm based on degree reduction that transforms task assignment into a bipartite graph matching. Extensive experiments offer insight into the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.",

            "abstract": "\n Correlated time series (CTS) forecasting plays an essential role in many cyber-physical systems, where multiple sensors emit time series that capture interconnected processes. Solutions based on deep learning that deliver state-of-the-art CTS forecasting performance employ a variety of spatio-temporal (ST) blocks that are able to model temporal dependencies and spatial correlations among time series. However, two challenges remain. First, ST-blocks are designed manually, which is time consuming and costly. Second, existing forecasting models simply stack the same ST-blocks multiple times, which limits the model potential. To address these challenges, we propose\n AutoCTS\n that is able to automatically identify highly competitive ST-blocks as well as forecasting models with heterogeneous ST-blocks connected using diverse topologies, as opposed to the same ST-blocks connected using simple stacking. Specifically, we design both a micro and a macro search space to model possible architectures of ST-blocks and the connections among heterogeneous ST-blocks, and we provide a search strategy that is able to jointly explore the search spaces to identify optimal forecasting models. Extensive experiments on eight commonly used CTS forecasting benchmark datasets justify our design choices and demonstrate that\n AutoCTS\n is capable of automatically discovering forecasting models that outperform state-of-the-art human-designed models.\n",

            "abstract": "Increasingly available trajectory data enables detailed capture of traffic conditions. We consider an uncertain road network graph, where each graph edge is associated with a travel time distribution, and we study probabilistic budget routing that aims to find the path with the highest probability of arriving within a given time budget. In this setting, a fundamental operation is to compute the travel cost distribution of a path from the cost distributions of the edges in the path. Solutions that rely on convolution generally assume independence among the edges\u2019 distributions, which often does not hold and thus incurs poor accuracy. We propose a hybrid approach that combines convolution and machine learning-based estimation to take into account dependencies among distributions in order to improve accuracy. Next, we propose an efficient routing algorithm that is able to utilize the hybrid approach and that features effective pruning techniques to enable faster routing. Empirical studies on a substantial real-world trajectory set offer insight into the properties of the proposed solution, indicating that it is promising.",

            "abstract": "Networked data, notably social network data, often comes with a rich set of annotations, or attributes, such as documents (e.g., tweets) and locations (e.g., check-ins). Community search in such attributed networks has been studied intensively due to its many applications in friends recommendation, event organization, advertising, etc. We study the problem of attribute-constrained co-located community (ACOC) search, which returns a community that satisfies three properties: i) structural cohesiveness: the members in the community are densely connected; ii) spatial co-location: the members are close to each other; and iii) attribute constraint: a set of attributes are covered by the attributes associated with the members. The ACOC problem is shown to be NP-hard. We develop four efficient approximation algorithms with guaranteed error bounds in addition to an exact solution that works on relatively small graphs. Extensive experiments conducted with both real and synthetic data offer insight into the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing that they outperform three adapted state-of-the-art algorithms by an order of magnitude. We also find that the approximation algorithms are much faster than the exact solution and yet offer high accuracy.",

In a Time t, more objects are updated to the tree than usual. It saves the cost of regular update as well.

ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS 2011 brings together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners who share interests in novel systems based on geo-spatial data and knowledge. The conference fosters interdisciplinary discussions and research on all aspects of Geographic Information Systems and Science (GIS) and provides a forum for original research contributions covering all conceptual, design, and implementation aspects of GIS and ranging from applications, user interface considerations, and visualization to storage management and indexing issues. This is the fourth time the conference is being held under the auspices of the ACM Special Interest Group on Spatial Information (SIGSPATIAL). \n \nWe solicited submissions in four tracks: research papers, industrial papers, demonstrations, and Ph.D. showcase papers. We received a total of 200 submissions. The research paper track attracted 160 submissions, of which 35 were accepted as full papers and another 30 papers were accepted as poster papers and appear in these proceedings. The industry track attracted 6 submissions of which 1 was accepted as a full paper and 2 were accepted as poster papers and also appear in the proceedings. The Ph.D. Showcase track received 11 submissions, of which 4 were accepted and will appear in the ACM SIGSPATIAL newsletter. Next, the demonstrations track received 23 submissions, of which 14 were accepted and are allotted 4 pages each in the proceedings. Finally, 2 research paper submissions were accepted as demos. All submissions were reviewed by a program committee of some 126 members. Each submission received at least 3 reviews, and in the vast majority of cases 4 reviews. This resulted in 780 reviews over all tracks. These numbers indicate that the research field of geographic information systems is a thriving and exciting field.",
