            "abstract": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) aims to automatically answer natural language questions related to given image content. Existing VQA methods integrate vision modeling and language understanding to explore the deep semantics of the question. However, these methods ignore the significant syntax information of the question, which plays a vital role in understanding the essential semantics of the question and guiding the visual feature refinement. To fill the gap, we suggested a novel Syntax Tree Constrained Graph Network (STCGN) for VQA based on entity message passing and syntax tree. This model is able to extract a syntax tree from questions and obtain more precise syntax information. Specifically, we parse questions and obtain the question syntax tree using the Stanford syntax parsing tool. From the word level and phrase level, syntactic phrase features and question features are extracted using a hierarchical tree convolutional network. We then design a message-passing mechanism for phrase-aware visual entities and capture entity features according to a given visual context. Extensive experiments on VQA2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.",

            "title": "Causal Intervention for Abstractive Related Work Generation",
            "abstract": "Abstractive related work generation has attracted increasing attention in generating coherent related work that better helps readers grasp the background in the current research. However, most existing abstractive models ignore the inherent causality of related work generation, leading to low quality of generated related work and spurious correlations that affect the models' generalizability. In this study, we argue that causal intervention can address these limitations and improve the quality and coherence of the generated related works. To this end, we propose a novel Causal Intervention Module for Related Work Generation (CaM) to effectively capture causalities in the generation process and improve the quality and coherence of the generated related works. Specifically, we first model the relations among sentence order, document relation, and transitional content in related work generation using a causal graph. Then, to implement the causal intervention and mitigate the negative impact of spurious correlations, we use do-calculus to derive ordinary conditional probabilities and identify causal effects through CaM. Finally, we subtly fuse CaM with Transformer to obtain an end-to-end generation model. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that causal interventions in CaM can effectively promote the model to learn causal relations and produce related work of higher quality and coherence.",
