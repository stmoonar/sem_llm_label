            "title": "Adversarial NLP for Social Network Applications: Attacks, Defenses, and Research Directions",
            "abstract": "The growing use of media has led to the development of several machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) tools to process the unprecedented amount of social media content to make actionable decisions. However, these ML and NLP algorithms have been widely shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. These vulnerabilities allow adversaries to launch a diversified set of adversarial attacks on these algorithms in different applications of social media text processing. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the main approaches for adversarial attacks and defenses in the context of social media applications with a particular focus on key challenges and future research directions. In detail, we cover literature on six key applications: 1) rumors detection; 2) satires detection; 3) clickbaits and spams identification; 4) hate speech detection; 5) misinformation detection; and 6) sentiment analysis. We then highlight the concurrent and anticipated future research questions and provide recommendations and directions for future work.",

            "title": "Toward Improved Reliability of Deep Learning Based Systems Through Online Relabeling of Potential Adversarial Attacks",
            "abstract": "Deep neural networks have shown vulnerability to well-designed inputs called adversarial examples. Researchers in industry and academia have proposed many adversarial example defense techniques. However, they offer partial but not full robustness. Thus, complementing them with another layer of protection is a must, especially for mission-critical applications. This article proposes a novel online selection and relabeling algorithm (OSRA) that opportunistically utilizes a limited number of crowdsourced workers to maximize the machine learning (ML) system's robustness. The OSRA strives to use crowdsourced workers effectively by selecting the most suspicious inputs and moving them to the crowdsourced workers to be validated and corrected. As a result, the impact of adversarial examples gets reduced, and accordingly, the ML system becomes more robust. We also proposed a heuristic threshold selection method that contributes to enhancing the prediction system's reliability. We empirically validated our proposed algorithm and found that it can efficiently and optimally utilize the allocated budget for crowdsourcing. It is also effectively integrated with a state-of-the-art black box defense technique, resulting in a more robust system. Simulation results show that the OSRA can outperform a random selection algorithm by 60% and achieve comparable performance to an optimal offline selection benchmark. They also show that OSRA's performance has a positive correlation with system robustness.",

            "abstract": "This paper focuses on an important environmental challenge; namely, water quality by analyzing the potential of social media as an immediate source of feedback. The main goal of the work is to automatically analyze and retrieve social media posts relevant to water quality with particular attention to posts describing di \ufb00 erent aspects of water quality, such as watercolor, smell, taste, and related illnesses. To this aim, we propose a novel framework incorporating di \ufb00 erent preprocessing, data augmentation, and classi\ufb01-cation techniques. In total, three di \ufb00 erent Neural Networks (NNs) architectures, namely (i) Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), (ii) Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training Approach (XLM-RoBERTa), and (iii) custom Long short-term memory (LSTM) model, are employed in a merit-based fusion scheme. For merit-based weight assignment to the models, several optimization and search techniques are compared including a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a Genetic Algorithm (GA), Brute Force (BF), Nelder-Mead, and Powell\u2019s optimization methods. We also provide an evaluation of the individual models where the highest F1-score of 0.81 is obtained with the BERT model. In merit-based fusion, overall better results are obtained with BF achieving an F1-score score of 0.852. We also provide comparison against existing methods, where a signi\ufb01cant improvement for our proposed solutions is obtained. We believe such rigorous analysis of this relatively new topic will provide a baseline for future research.",

            "title": "Exploration and Exploitation in Federated Learning to Exclude Clients with Poisoned Data",
            "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is one of the hot research topics, and it utilizes Machine Learning (ML) in a distributed manner without directly accessing private data on clients. How-ever, FL faces many challenges, including the difficulty to obtain high accuracy, high communication cost between clients and the server, and security attacks related to adversarial ML. To tackle these three challenges, we propose an FL algorithm inspired by evolutionary techniques. The proposed algorithm groups clients randomly in many clusters, each with a model selected randomly to explore the performance of different models. The clusters are then trained in a repetitive process where the worst performing cluster is removed in each iteration until one cluster remains. In each iteration, some clients are expelled from clusters either due to using poisoned data or low performance. The surviving clients are exploited in the next iteration. The remaining cluster with surviving clients is then used for training the best FL model (i.e., remaining FL model). Communication cost is reduced since fewer clients are used in the final training of the FL model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conduct a number of experiments using FEMNIST dataset and compare the result against the random FL algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithm in terms of accuracy, communication cost, and security.",

            "abstract": "Contact tracing has been globally adopted in the fight to control the infection rate of COVID-19. Thanks to digital technologies, such as smartphones and wearable devices, contacts of COVID-19 patients can be easily traced and informed about their potential exposure to the virus. To this aim, several interesting mobile applications have been developed. However, there are ever-growing concerns over the working mechanism and performance of these applications. The literature already provides some interesting exploratory studies on the community's response to the applications by analyzing information from different sources, such as news and users' reviews of the applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing solution that automatically analyzes users' reviews and extracts the evoked sentiments. In this work, we propose a pipeline starting from manual annotation via a crowd-sourcing study and concluding on the development and training of AI models for automatic sentiment analysis of users' reviews. In total, we employ eight different methods achieving up to an average F1-Scores 94.8% indicating the feasibility of automatic sentiment analysis of users' reviews on the COVID-19 contact tracing applications. We also highlight the key advantages, drawbacks, and users' concerns over the applications. Moreover, we also collect and annotate a large-scale dataset composed of 34,534 reviews manually annotated from the contract tracing applications of 46 distinct countries. The presented analysis and the dataset are expected to provide a baseline/benchmark for future research in the domain.",
