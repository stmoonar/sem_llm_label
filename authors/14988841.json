            "title": "Image Reconstruction Using Variable Exponential Function Regularization for Wide-Field Polarization Modulation Imaging",
            "abstract": "Polarization modulation imaging technology plays an important role in microscopic super-resolution imaging. However, the specimen medium contains retardancy, while charge-coupled devices may provide discrete under-sampling, and the coupled wavefronts consisting of the polarization state of the light and the anisotropic distribution of the specimen can lead to vectorial phase fitting degradation. Considering that the point spread function (PSF) of the main degradation parts can be regarded as an asymmetric generalized Gaussian distribution with uncertain parameters, an adaptive image reconstruction method is proposed based on variable exponential function regularization. The proposed method concentrates on the diversity of the PSF and uses a variable exponent regularization to improve flexibility of the kernel. Moreover, it can balance image edge preservation and provide staircase artifact suppression, which reduces the over- and under-reconstruction of the microscopic images effectively. By optimizing the Split\u2013Bregman algorithm, we create an efficient method that minimizes the iterative loss function under the premise of achieving high estimation accuracy. Compared with other methods, the experimental results reveal better effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, with improvements of 18% in the peak signal-to-noise ratio, 21% in the structural similarity index measurement, and 337% in the mean structural similarity index measurement.",

            "abstract": "In optical imaging of biological tissues, surface reflection is a serious issue in many cases, while near-infrared (NIR) light can be used for deep imaging of biological tissues due to its strong tissue penetration ability and weaker light scattering in tissues. In this article, a method based on parametric imaging of the polarization status of reflected or transmitted light from biological tissues in the NIR spectrum was proposed. By modulating the polarization states of the NIR illumination source, recording the images of the samples, the far-field variation of the pixel intensity of recorded images was fitted to a theoretical model, and a series of polarization parametric images were obtained. These images describe the relation between the polarization status of the reflected or transmitted light and the properties of the samples. A tissue phantom with deep buried test target was imaged successfully. This method can provide a useful detection method for the deep imaging of biomedical tissues.",

As a non-destructive, high resolution, high contrast test method, photoacoustic imaging uses the endogenous optical absorption characteristics of the sample for imaging and obtains the structural and functional information of the sample.

Polarization imaging is achieved by rotating the polarizer and quarter wave plate, which can obtain parametric images of Stokes parameters, the polarization phase retardance, and the polarization ellipticity orientation angle. Hyperspectral imaging is achieved by using an electronically controlled liquid crystal wavelength filter in front of the broad-band visible light source. By calculating and integrating the intensity and parametric images under different illumination spectrum, the limitation of current polarization imaging due to the wavelength-dependent absorption of the sample was avoided. A significant improvement in resolving power and contrast was found in the imaging results of oocyte cells.",
