            "abstract": "Path following is a crucial technique for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of automatic electric vehicles. Four-wheel steering (4WS) technology is known to enhance the accuracy and flexibility of such vehicles. In this paper, we propose a new constrained model predictive control (MPC) based method for path-following, specifically for 4WS vehicles. To simplify the 4WS vehicle kinematics model, we use the assumption of pure rolling and simplify it to a single-track model. We employ a high-precision linearization transformation to convert the nonlinear kinematics models to a linear control-state system. Subsequently, we design a new objective function based on the tracking error model, and formulate the control problem as an optimization problem. Finally, we convert the optimization problem into a quadratic programming (QP) form with constraints that are suitable for real-time applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed control method through simulation experiments.",

            "title": "Generative Evolutionary Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Networks",
            "abstract": "Anomaly detection in dynamic networks aims to find network elements (e.g., nodes, edges, subgraphs, change points) with significantly different behaviors from the vast majority, it can also devote to community detection and evolution and prediction tasks. Most existing methods focus on one specific task, that is, only detect anomalies of one type of element isolated, so they lose the ability to model the correlation and driving mechanism between different abnormal behavior. Considering that the anomaly detection of one type of element is helpful to other types of elements, i.e., the temporal evolution hidden the dynamic networks are driven by indivisible behavior patterns. So in this paper, we propose a unified Generation model to analyze the dynamic network for Exploring the Abnormal Behaviors of different Scales (GEABS). It can model the relation and catch different levels (node, community and network) of anomaly with a joint statistical network model and detect the community structure and its evolution. Specifically, we denote the parameters of node popularity, community membership to generate the dynamic network with stochastic block model (SBM), we also describe the varying of node and community by dynamic process. With a well-designed generative mechanism, it can detect the change point on network level, temporal evolution on community level and abnormal behavior on node level synchronously, besides, it also detects the community structure effectively. We also propose an effective optimization algorithm with variational inference. Experimental results show that the GEABS achieves better performance on abnormal behavior and community structure compared with baselines.",

            "title": "Exploring Temporal Community Structure via Network Embedding",
            "abstract": "Temporal community detection is helpful to discover and analyze significant groups or clusters hidden in dynamic networks in the real world. A variety of methods, such as modularity optimization, spectral method, and statistical network model, has been developed from diversified perspectives. Recently, network embedding-based technologies have made significant progress, and one can exploit deep learning superiority to network tasks. Although some methods for static networks have shown promising results in boosting community detection by integrating community embedding, they are not suitable for temporal networks and unable to capture their dynamics. Furthermore, the dynamic embedding methods only model network varying without considering community structures. Hence, in this article, we propose a novel unsupervised dynamic community detection model, which is based on network embedding and can effectively discover temporal communities and model dynamic networks. More specifically, we propose the community prior by introducing the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in the variational autoencoder, which can obtain community information and better model the evolutionary characteristics of community structure and node embedding by utilizing the variant of gated recurrent unit (GRU). Extensive experiments conducted in real-world and artificial networks demonstrate that our proposed model has a better effect on improving the accuracy of dynamic community detection.",

            "title": "HB-DSBM: Modeling the Dynamic Complex Networks From Community Level to Node Level",
            "abstract": "A variety of methods have been proposed for modeling and mining dynamic complex networks, in which the topological structure varies with time. As the most popular and successful network model, the stochastic block model (SBM) has been extended and applied to community detection, link prediction, anomaly detection, and evolution analysis of dynamic networks. However, all current models based on the SBM for modeling dynamic networks are designed at the community level, assuming that nodes in each community have the same dynamic behavior, which usually results in poor performance on temporal community detection and loses the modeling of node abnormal behavior. To solve the above-mentioned problem, this article proposes a hierarchical Bayesian dynamic SBM (HB-DSBM) for modeling the node-level and community-level dynamic behavior in a dynamic network synchronously. Based on the SBM, we introduce a hierarchical Dirichlet generative mechanism to associate the global community evolution with the microscopic transition behavior of nodes near-perfectly and generate the observed links across the dynamic networks. Meanwhile, an effective variational inference algorithm is developed and we can easy to infer the communities and dynamic behaviors of the nodes. Furthermore, with the two-level evolution behaviors, it can identify nodes or communities with abnormal behavior. Experiments on simulated and real-world networks demonstrate that HB-DSBM has achieved state-of-the-art performance on community detection and evolution. In addition, abnormal evolutionary behavior and events on dynamic networks can be effectively identified by our model.",
