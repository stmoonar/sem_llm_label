            "title": "Alleviating Matthew Effect of Offline Reinforcement Learning in Interactive Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL), a technology that offline learns a policy from logged data without the need to interact with online environments, has become a favorable choice in decision-making processes like interactive recommendation. Offline RL faces the value overestimation problem. To address it, existing methods employ conservatism, e.g., by constraining the learned policy to be close to behavior policies or punishing the rarely visited state-action pairs. However, when applying such offline RL to recommendation, it will cause a severe Matthew effect, i.e., the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, by promoting popular items or categories while suppressing the less popular ones. It is a notorious issue that needs to be addressed in practical recommender systems. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the Matthew effect in offline RL-based recommendation. Through theoretical analyses, we find that the conservatism of existing methods fails in pursuing users' long-term satisfaction. It inspires us to add a penalty term to relax the pessimism on states with high entropy of the logging policy and indirectly penalizes actions leading to less diverse states. This leads to the main technical contribution of the work: Debiased model-based Offline RL (DORL) method. Experiments show that DORL not only captures user interests well but also alleviates the Matthew effect. The implementation is available via https://github.com/chongminggao/DORL-codes",

            "abstract": "Interactive data exploration (IDE) is an effective way of comprehending big data, whose volume and complexity are beyond human abilities. The main goal of IDE is to discover user interest regions from a database through multi-rounds of user labelling. Existing IDEs adopt active-learning framework, where users iteratively discriminate or label the interestingness of selected tuples. The process of data exploration can be viewed as the process of training of a classifier, which determines whether a database tuple is interesting to a user. An efficient exploration thus takes very few iterations of user labelling to reach the data region of interest. In this work, we consider the data exploration as the process of few-shot learning, where the classifier is learned with only a few training examples, or exploration iterations. To this end, we propose a learning-to-explore framework, based on meta-learning, which learns how to learn a classifier with automatically generated meta-tasks, so that the exploration process can be much shortened. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that our proposal outperforms existing explore-by-example solutions in terms of accuracy and efficiency.",

            "abstract": "The world of data objects and systems is complex and heterogeneous, making collaboration across tools, teams, and institutions difficult. Important goals like effective data science, responsible data governance, and well-informed data consumption all require participation from multiple parties who share conceptual data models despite being unfamiliar with, or organizationally distant from each other. In order to be productive together, data collaborators need a shared conceptual model that includes traditional schemas and system models, such as pipelines and procedures. This shared model does not have to be entirely correct, but to enable effective collaboration, it should be tool, team, and institution-independent. We describe a working demonstration system that aims to build this shared conceptual model. This system borrows ideas from knowledge graphs and other massive collaborative efforts to curate data artifacts beyond the reach of any one person or institution.",

            "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed a growth in the use of knowledge graph technologies for advanced data search, data integration, and query-answering applications. The leading example of a public, general-purpose open knowledge network (aka\u00a0knowledge graph) is Wikidata, which has demonstrated remarkable advances in quality and coverage over this time. Proprietary knowledge graphs drive some of the leading applications of the day including, for example, Google Search, Alexa, Siri, and Cortana. Open Knowledge Networks are exciting: they promise the power of structured database-like queries with the potential for the wide coverage that is today only provided by the Web. With the current state of the art, building, using, and scaling large knowledge networks can still be frustratingly slow.

Despite the initial success, many key challenges remain open. Here, we introduce Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC), the first unifying framework to systematically access and evaluate machine learning across the entire range of therapeutics. At its core, TDC is a collection of curated datasets and learning tasks that can translate algorithmic innovation into biomedical and clinical implementation. To date, TDC includes 66 machine learning-ready datasets from 22 learning tasks, spanning the discovery and development of safe and effective medicines. TDC also provides an ecosystem of tools, libraries, leaderboards, and community resources, including data functions, strategies for systematic model evaluation, meaningful data splits, data processors, and molecule generation oracles. All datasets and learning tasks are integrated and accessible via an open-source library. We envision that TDC can facilitate algorithmic and scientific advances and accelerate development, validation, and transition into production and clinical implementation. TDC is a continuous, open-source initiative, and we invite contributions from the research community. TDC is publicly available at this https URL.",

            "abstract": "With the remarkable success of representation learning in providing powerful predictions and data insights, we have witnessed a rapid expansion of representation learning techniques into modeling, analysis, and learning with networks. Biomedical networks are universal descriptors of systems of interacting elements, from protein interactions to disease networks, all the way to healthcare systems and scienti\ufb01c knowledge. In this review, we put forward an observation that long-standing principles of network biology and medicine\u2014while often unspoken in machine learning research\u2014can provide the conceptual grounding for representation learning, explain its current successes and limitations, and inform future advances. We synthesize a spectrum of algorithmic approaches that, at their core, leverage topological features to embed networks into compact vector spaces. We also provide a taxonomy of biomedical areas that are likely to bene\ufb01t most from algorithmic innovation. Representation learning techniques are becoming essential for identifying causal variants underlying complex traits, disentangling behaviors of single cells and their impact on health, and diagnosing and treating diseases with safe and e\ufb00ective medicines.",

            "abstract": "Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) aims to locate the specific image in a large collection of images without any meta-data. Current techniques focus on manipulating image pixel spaces (such as shape, color, and texture) but face two challenges: limitation of representation and inaccuracy of image similarity measurement. We address these two problems by using image captioning model to generate rich textual meta-data, which translates the pixel space into text space where many textual similarity measurements and ranking methods can be applied. Our preliminary result shows this approach has great promise.",
