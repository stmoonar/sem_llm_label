            "abstract": "This work proposes a \"learning-augmented clinical assessment\" workflow to sequentially augment physician assessments of patients' symptoms and their socio-demographic measures with heterogeneous biological measures to accurately predict treatment outcomes using machine learning. Across many psychiatric illnesses, ranging from major depressive disorder to schizophrenia, symptom severity assessments are subjective and do not include biological measures, making predictability in eventual treatment outcomes a challenge. Using data from the Mayo Clinic PGRN-AMPS SSRI trial as a case study, this work demonstrates a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy for antidepressant treatment outcomes in patients with major depressive disorder from 35% to 80% individualized by patient, compared to using only a physician?s assessment as the predictors. This improvement is achieved through an iterative overlay of biological measures, starting with metabolites (blood measures modulated by drug action) associated with symptom severity, and then adding in genes associated with metabolomic concentrations. Hence, therapeutic efficacy for a new patient can be assessed prior to treatment, using prediction models that take as inputs selected biological measures and physicians' assessments of depression severity. Of broader significance extending beyond psychiatry, the approach presented in this work can potentially be applied to predicting treatment outcomes for other medical conditions, such as migraine headaches or rheumatoid arthritis, for which patients are treated according to subject-reported assessments of symptom severity.",

            "abstract": "This paper proposes a data-driven longitudinal model that brings together factor graphs and learning methods to demonstrate a significant improvement in predictability in clinical outcomes of patients with major depressive disorder treated with antidepressants. Using data from the Mayo Clinic PGRN-AMPS trial and the STAR\u2217D trial for validation, this work makes two significant contributions in the context of predictability in psychiatric therapeutic outcomes. First, we establish symptom dynamics in response to antidepressants by using the forward algorithm on a factor graph. Symptom dynamics are the changes in the symptom severity that are most likely to occur because of the antidepressants taken during the trial, and the associated clinical outcomes at 4 weeks and 8 weeks into the trial. The structure of the factor graph is inferred by using unsupervised learning to stratify patients by the similarity of their overall symptom severity. Second, by using metabolomics data as an accurate biological measure in addition to symptom survey data and other patient history information, the prediction of clinical outcomes such as response and remission significantly improved from 30% to 68% in men, and from 35% to 72% in women. This work demonstrates a significant difference in how men and women respond to antidepressants in terms of their symptom dynamics, and also shows that top predictors of clinical outcomes for men and women are significantly different and known to play a role in behavioral sciences.",

Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) approaches provide exciting opportunity to guide feature selection in agnostic metabolic profiling endeavors, where potentially thousands of independent data points must be evaluated. In previous research, AutoML using high-dimensional data of varying types has been demonstrably robust, outperforming traditional approaches. However, considerations for application in clinical metabolic profiling remain to be evaluated. Particularly, regarding the robustness of AutoML to identify and adjust for common clinical confounders. In this study, we present a focused case study regarding AutoML considerations for using the Tree-Based Optimization Tool (TPOT) in metabolic profiling of exposure to metformin in a biobank cohort. First, we propose a tandem rank-accuracy measure to guide agnostic feature selection and corresponding threshold determination in clinical metabolic profiling endeavors. Second, while AutoML, using default parameters, demonstrated potential to lack sensitivity to low-effect confounding clinical covariates, we demonstrated residual training and adjustment of metabolite features as an easily applicable approach to ensure AutoML adjustment for potential confounding characteristics. Finally, we present increased homocysteine with long-term exposure to metformin as a potentially novel, non-replicated metabolite association suggested by TPOT; an association not identified in parallel clinical metabolic profiling endeavors. While warranting independent replication, our tandem rank-accuracy measure suggests homocysteine to be the metabolite feature with largest effect, and corresponding priority for further translational clinical research. Residual training and adjustment for a potential confounding effect by BMI only slightly modified the suggested association. Increased homocysteine is thought to be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency \u2013 evaluation for potential clinical relevance is suggested. While considerations for clinical metabolic profiling are recommended, including adjustment approaches for clinical confounders, AutoML presents an exciting tool to enhance clinical metabolic profiling and advance translational research endeavors.",

            "abstract": "Purpose The majority of cancer patients receive treatments that are minimally informed by omics data. We propose a precision medicine computational framework (PANOPLY: Precision cancer genomic report: single sample inventory) to identify and prioritize drug targets and cancer therapy regimens. Methods The PANOPLY approach integrates clinical data with germline and somatic features obtained from multi-omics platforms, and apply machine learning, and network analysis approaches in the context of the individual patient and matched controls. The PANOPLY workflow employs four steps (i) selection of matched controls to the case of interest (ii) identification of case-specific genomic events (iii) identification of suitable drugs using the driver-gene network and random forest analyses and (iv) provide an integrated multi-omics case report of the patient with prioritization of anti-cancer drugs. Results The PANOPLY workflow can be executed on a stand-alone virtual machine and is also available for download as an R package. We applied the method to an institutional breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy study which collected clinical and genomic data as well as patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to investigate the prioritization offered by PANOPLY. In a chemotherapy-resistant PDX model, we found that that the prioritized drug, olaparib, was more effective than placebo in treating the tumor (P < 0.05). We also applied PANOPLY to in-house and publicly accessible multi-omics tumor datasets with therapeutic response or survival data available. Conclusion PANOPLY shows promise as a means to prioritize drugs based on clinical and multi-omics data for an individual cancer patient. Additional studies are needed to confirm this approach.",

            "abstract": "This paper demonstrates an unsupervised learning approach to identify genes with significant differential expression across single-cell subpopulations induced by therapeutic treatment. Identifying this set of genes makes it possible to use well-established bioinformatics approaches such as pathway analysis to establish their biological relevance. Then, a biologist can use his/her prior knowledge to investigate in the laboratory, a few particular candidates among the subset of genes overlapping with relevant pathways. Due to the large size of the human genome and limitations in cost and skilled resources, biologists benefit from analytical methods combined with pathway analysis to design laboratory experiments focusing on only a few significant genes. As an example, we show how model-based unsupervised methods can identify a small set of genes (1% of the genome) that have significant differential expression in single-cells and are also highly correlated to pathways (p-value < 1E \u2212 7) with anticancer effects driven by the antidiabetic drug metformin. Further analysis of genes on these relevant pathways reveal three candidate genes previously implicated in several anticancer mechanisms in other cancers, not driven by metformin. Identification of these genes can help biologists and clinicians design laboratory experiments to establish the molecular mechanisms of metformin in triple-negative breast cancer. In a domain where there is no prior knowledge of small biologically significant data, we demonstrate that careful data-driven methods can infer such significant small data to explain biological mechanisms.",

Specificity (all categories): 96.14%-100%; sensitivity (categories (0)-(4)): 90.27%-99.83%; sensitivity (categories (5)-(6)): 0-23.53%; positive predictive values: 80%-97.38%; negative predictive values: 96.91%-99.93%.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nOur approach illustrates a secondary use of the electronic medical record. The main challenge is event temporality.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe present an algorithm for automated treatment classification within an electronic medical record to combine information extracted through natural language processing with that extracted from structured databases. The algorithm has high specificity for all categories, high sensitivity for five categories, and low sensitivity for two categories.",
