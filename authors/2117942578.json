            "abstract": "ICD coding is designed to assign the disease codes to electronic health records (EHRs) upon discharge, which is crucial for billing and clinical statistics. In an attempt to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of manual coding, many methods have been proposed to automatically predict ICD codes from clinical notes. However, most previous works ignore the decisive information contained in structured medical data in EHRs, which is hard to be captured from the noisy clinical notes. In this paper, we propose a Tree-enhanced Multimodal Attention Network (TreeMAN) to fuse tabular features and textual features into multimodal representations by enhancing the text representations with tree-based features via the attention mechanism. Tree-based features are constructed according to decision trees learned from structured multimodal medical data, which capture the decisive information about ICD coding. We can apply the same multi-label classifier from previous text models to the multimodal representations to predict ICD codes. Experiments on two MIMIC datasets show that our method outperforms prior state-of-the-art ICD coding approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/liu-zichen/TreeMAN.",

            "abstract": "Taxonomies are hierarchical classifications widely exploited to facilitate downstream natural language processing tasks. The taxonomy expansion task aims to incorporate emergent concepts into the existing taxonomies. Prior works focus on modeling the local substructure of taxonomies but neglect the global structure. In this paper, we propose TaxoPrompt, a framework that learns the global structure by prompt tuning with taxonomic context. Prompt tuning leverages a template to formulate downstream tasks into masked language model form for better distributed semantic knowledge use. To further infuse global structure knowledge into language models, we enhance the prompt template by exploiting the taxonomic context constructed by a variant of the random walk algorithm. Experiments on seven public benchmarks show that our proposed TaxoPrompt is effective and efficient in automatically expanding taxonomies and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

            "abstract": "Contour-based instance segmentation methods are attractive due to their efficiency. However, existing contour-based methods either suffer from lossy representation, complex pipeline or difficulty in model training, resulting in sub-par mask accuracy on challenging datasets like MS-COCO. In this work, we propose a novel deep attentive contour model, named DANCE, to achieve better instance segmentation accuracy while remaining good efficiency. To this end, DANCE applies two new designs: attentive contour deformation to refine the quality of segmentation contours and segment-wise matching to ease the model training. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DANCE excels at deforming the initial contour in a more natural and efficient way towards the real object boundaries. Effectiveness of DANCE is also validated on the COCO dataset, which achieves 38.1% mAP and outperforms all other contour-based instance segmentation models. To the best of our knowledge, DANCE is the first contour-based model that achieves comparable performance to pixel-wise segmentation models. Code is available at https://github.com/lkevinzc/dance.",

Towards this end, new features depend on weight taken from image or video used in proposed descriptor. Human pose plays an important role in extracted features; then these features are used as the weight input with classifier. We use machine learning during two steps of training and testing images of standard dataset that can be used during benchmarking the system. Unlike previous methods that need size or length of shapes mainly to represent the cues when machine learning is used to recognize human activities, accurate experimental results coming from appropriate segments of the human body proved the worthiness of proposed method. Twelve activities are used in challenging of availability comparison with dataset to demonstrate our method. The results show that we achieved 87.3% in training set, while in testing set, we achieved 94% in terms of precision.",

            "abstract": "As an essential form of knowledge representation, taxonomies are widely used in various downstream natural language processing tasks. However, with the continuously rising of new concepts, many existing taxonomies are unable to maintain coverage by manual expansion. In this paper, we propose TEMP, a self-supervised taxonomy expansion method, which predicts the position of new concepts by ranking the generated taxonomy-paths. For the first time, TEMP employs pre-trained contextual encoders in taxonomy construction and hypernym detection problems. Experiments prove that pre-trained contextual embeddings are able to capture hypernym-hyponym relations. To learn more detailed differences between taxonomy-paths, we train the model with dynamic margin loss by a novel dynamic margin function. Extensive evaluations exhibit that TEMP outperforms prior state-of-the-art taxonomy expansion approaches by 14.3% in accuracy and 15.8% in mean reciprocal rank on three public benchmarks.",

Unlike existing caching systems for fast data access where each cache hit saves one disk I/O, GC reduces the computational costs due to subgraph isomorphism testing. Moreover, GC harnesses both subgraph and supergraph cache hits, extending the traditional exact-match-only hit, thus resulting in significant speedups. Furthermore, GC features dashboards for both skilled developers and general end-users; the former could investigate and experiment with alternative components/mechanisms while the latter could look into the principle of GC through a number of demonstration scenarios.",

            "abstract": "\n \n The widespread adoption of smartphones has made it possible for large numbers of people to geotag their social media posts. Past work has studied the reasons people tag their location and the ways they do so on location-based social networks like Foursquare. But it is unclear how well these findings generalize to other social media not centered on location, such as Twitter or Flickr. Through an analysis of public data and two surveys, we investigate why people geotag their photos, tweets, and other non-location-based social media. We found that their reasons are similar to those in location-based social networks. We also found several surprises due to the different nature of these platforms and the changes since location-based social networks were introduced. For example, people usually consciously geotag, though a significant portion geotags unintentionally; coordinate geotagging is changing to placetagging; and job-posting bots constitute a growing portion of public geotags.\n \n",
