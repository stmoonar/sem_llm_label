            "title": "RBEER: Rule-Based Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol for Large-Scale UWSNs",
            "abstract": "Recently, underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have seen increasing popularity owing to their extensive applications in aquatic environments, including monitoring underwater pipelines, detecting pollution and disasters, researching marine life, underwater surveillance, and facilitating military surveillance. In fact, the task of devising an adequate routing algorithm is particularly challenging because of the unique underwater environmental conditions. These challenges include energy constraints, dynamic topology, long propagation delays, bandwidth limitations, mobility, and 3-D deployments. Therefore, this study addresses the aforementioned challenges and proposes RBEER, a rule-based energy-efficient routing protocol for large-scale UWSNs. RBEER works in three steps: the first is the network initialization and network clustering, in which a Fuzzy C-means is utilized to perform the clustering and determine the cluster centers. The second step is using the RISE rule-based classifier to select the optimal cluster head (CH) based on five input parameters to generate the set of rules. The last step is data forwarding, in which data is forwarded through a single-hop intra-cluster path from member nodes to CH nodes, then through a multi-hop inter-cluster path from CH nodes to sink nodes. Extensive simulations and experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the RBEER protocol. The results demonstrate that the RBEER protocol outperforms benchmarks regarding packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and energy consumption.",

            "abstract": "Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is a promising technology that can potentially mitigate the energy provisioning problem for sensor networks. In order to efficiently replenish energy for these battery-powered devices, designing appropriate scheduling and charging path planning algorithms is essential and challenging. Whilst previous studies have tackled this challenge, the conjoint influences of network topology, charging path planning, and energy threshold distribution in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) are still in their infancy. We mitigate the aforementioned problem by proposing novel algorithmic solutions to efficient sector-based on-demand charging scheduling and path planning. Specifically, we first propose a hexagonal cluster-based deployment of nodes such that finding an NP-Complete Hamiltonian path is feasible. Second, each cluster is divided into multiple sectors and a charging path planning algorithm is implemented to yield a Hamiltonian path, aimed at improving the Mobile Charging Vehicle (MCV) efficiency and charging throughput. Third, we propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the importance of nodes to be used for charging duration decision-making and prioritization. Fourth, a non-preemptive dynamic priority scheduling algorithm is proposed for charging tasks\u2019 assignments and scheduling. Finally, extensive simulations have been conducted, revealing the significant advantages of our proposed algorithms in terms of energy efficiency, response time, dead nodes\u2019 density, and queuing processing.",

            "title": "Predictive Estimation of Optimal Signal Strength From Drones Over IoT Frameworks in Smart Cities",
            "abstract": "The integration of drones, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) domains can produce exceptional solutions to today complex problems in smart cities. A drone, which essentially is a data-gathering robot, can access geographical areas that are difficult, unsafe, or even impossible for humans to reach. Besides, communicating amongst themselves, such drones need to be in constant contact with other ground-based agents such as IoT sensors, robots, and humans. In this paper, an intelligent technique is proposed to predict the signal strength from a drone to IoT devices in smart cities in order to maintain the network connectivity, provide the desired quality of service (QoS), and identify the drone coverage area. An artificial neural network (ANN) based efficient and accurate solution is proposed to predict the signal strength from a drone based on several pertinent factors such as drone altitude, path loss, distance, transmitter height, receiver height, transmitted power, and signal frequency. Furthermore, the signal strength estimates are then used to predict the drone flying path. The findings show that the proposed ANN technique has achieved a good agreement with the validation data generated via simulations, yielding determination coefficient <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$R^2$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"alsamhi-ieq1-3074442.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> to be 0.96 and 0.98, for variation in drone altitude and distance from a drone, respectively. Therefore, the proposed ANN technique is reliable, useful, and fast to estimate the signal strength, determine the optimal drone flying path, and predict the next location based on received signal strength.",

            "abstract": "Recently, many sparse arrays are proposed to achieve increased uniform degrees of freedom (uDoFs) for the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation of non-circular sources. In light of this recent attention, the high number of uDoFs is the primary motivation for designing those sparse array structures. Although both the number of uDoF and mutual coupling can influence the DoA estimation performance. However, mutual coupling is not considered in many of those sparse array configurations. In this article, two optimized shifted coprime arrays with sum-difference coarrays, called OSCAwSDCa-I and OSCAwSDCa-II, are proposed to reduce mutual coupling. The OSCAwSDCa-I and OSCAwSDCa-II are obtained by rearranging actual sensors of the augmented coprime array. The proposed array designs have closed-form expressions for their sensor locations and achievable uDoFs. Additionally, it is proven that the first three weights of OSCAwSDCa-II are independent of the array size. Moreover, the number of virtual sensors co-locating at the same lag is reduced. Consequently, smaller weight values are obtained, resulting in more robustness against mutual coupling. Finally, extensive simulations show that OSCAwSDCa-I and OSCAwSDCa-II can achieve comparable uDoFs concerning the existing array structures. In the presence of strong mutual coupling, simulation results demonstrate the robustness of OSCAwSDCa-II more than other compared configurations.",

            "title": "TBDD: Territory-Bound Data Delivery for Large-Scale Mobile Sink Wireless Sensor Networks",
            "abstract": "The hierarchical structure-based data dissemination is the most popular technique in mobile sink wireless sensor networks (MS-WSNs). An ingenious virtual structure design combined with a precise routing management strategy is significant to attaining efficient data dissemination in hierarchical approaches. This article proposes a hierarchical protocol called territory-bound data delivery (TBDD) that divides the network into multiple partitions called Regions, and spots the location of the mobile sink (MS) according to these partitions. TBDD dynamically assigns a defined role to each division by adopting the mobility of the sink. Thus, the protocol takes advantage of the sink\u2019s movement and the Regions\u2019 flexible role in balancing energy consumption (EC) throughout the network. A Region is designated as active if it contains the sink node or passive otherwise. By using the territory of the active region as a temporal location of the MS, the proposed protocol hides the local movements (i.e., moves inside the active region) of the sink from the rest of the network. In such a way, regardless of the exact position of the sink, sensed data flows from different network ends to the sink\u2019s temporal location. Therefore, TBDD reduces the query request and response burden employed to get the position of the sink. Besides, TBDD implements a spanning tree to report the location information of the MS. Last, we applied an opportunistic routing technique that captures multiple network criteria to elect packet forwarder nodes. The proposed protocol is mathematically analyzed and experimentally evaluated and shows outstanding performance in terms of the number of hops, EC, delay, network lifetime, and success ratio.",

            "abstract": "Opportunistic routing (OR) is widely adopted in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) running asynchronous duty-cycled MAC protocols. In conventional routing, where packets are forwarded along predetermined routes, the sender may wait for the receiver to wake up for a long time. To reduce the sender waiting time, the OR protocols allow nodes to select multiple neighbors as the forwarders so that the packets could be forwarded by multi-path. Thus, the forwarders selection algorithm affects network performance seriously. However, an excessive number of forwarders increases the probability that more than one forwarders wake up simultaneously. This will consume more energy since each of them will receive the packet. To address the two issues, a Dynamic Opportunistic Routing protocol using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) called DORAF is proposed in this paper. DORAF is implemented in three steps. First, multiple criteria (i.e., residual energy, distance, and angle) at the network layer are defined to evaluate the nodes where the importance of these criteria is determined by AHP. Second, the pairwise comparison matrices in AHP are generated by using mathematical functions (i.e., Boltzmann function and Logistic function) and FIS. Third, each node uses AHP and FIS to prioritize its neighbors based on the criteria and selects appropriate ones as the forwarders dynamically in a distributed manner. The experimental results demonstrate that our protocol performs better than other state-of-the-art in terms of network lifetime, energy consumption, and average redundant transmissions.",

            "abstract": "The significance of the Knowledge Graph (KG) is rising across various industries. A KG is a powerful tool used to manage knowledge from vast amounts of resources effectively. In this paper, we propose an autonomous multimodal system for building a KG on the MuSe-CAR dataset. The system extracts several features of an entity from heterogeneous streams of the video, i.e., text and images, and represents them as fused Multi-Modal KG. We use the extracted features to explore the video content and learn to estimate queries and relationships between nodes of different modalities. This approach aims to enable users to perform a wider range of queries involving text and image data streams. The observation shows that multimodality either compensates for or corroborates knowledge in one stream with the other and allows the user to perform more queries. We evaluate the proposed system using a set of quantitative queries involving different data streams. The results of these queries can be used to gauge the system\u2019s effectiveness. Based on these evaluations, it is possible to understand how well the system can extract knowledge from the dataset and how useful it is for downstream applications such as querying.",

            "title": "Image Captioning With Novel Topics Guidance and Retrieval-Based Topics Re-Weighting",
            "abstract": "Topic modelling (TM) has shown significant progress in boosting the effectiveness of image captioning in the last few years. Although important improvements have been shown in previous topic-guided image captioning models, some challenges remain unsolved, such as the independence of the topic predictors and the sentence generators, resulting in ineffective exploitation of semantic information. Also, all the predicted topics or the top-one topic are used throughout the whole captioning task without considering the current time step's linguistic context, which deviates the captioning network to focus on inaccurate image objects. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel image captioning method consisting of four modules: enhanced topic predictor (ETP), retrieval-based topics re-weighting module (RTR), subsequent topic predictor (STP), and caption generation module. The prediction and generation modules are trained in an end-to-end manner to promote the efficient use of topics by predicting suitable topics at each time step. ETP predicts the topics using the image features, and is enhanced with topic embedding (TE). The RTR is only applied in the testing stage for re-weighting the topics predicted by ETP. In each time step, the STP automatically predicts concise topics subsets to alleviate the diversity of the image topics. Compared with the existing topic-based models, our model can automatically generate more accurate and diverse captions, boosting the explainability of how the topics influence the generated word in each time step. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmark datasets show that our method enhances the overall image captioning's performance and the topic prediction task, and outperforms many recent image captioning approaches in terms of the evaluation metrics.",

            "abstract": "The emerging Wireless Energy Transfer (WET) is a promising technology that has the potential to thwart the energy limitation challenge in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). WET-enabled WSNs are known as Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs). Over the last decade, various solutions have been suggested to minimize energy consumption and data delivery latency in WSNs. Among them, employing a mobile data collector has proven to be the most efficient solution. Motivated by this fact, we propose an on-demand recharging and data collection scheme called RECO, which employs dual-functioning mobile chargers (MCs) for both operations. RECO includes three essential procedures. 1) It clusters the network into multiple regions and defines two nonoverlapping itineraries on each partition; 2) It designs an efficient scheduling algorithm based on an Adapted Graham-Scan Algorithm (A-GSA); and 3) It defines anchor points to integrate the recharging and data dissemination processes. RECO is ideal for data delivery delay non-tolerant applications that were ignored by prior periodic recharging and data collection schemes. The experimental results demonstrate that RECO outperforms benchmarks regarding recharging and data collection efficiency.",
