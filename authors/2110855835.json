            "abstract": "Sets have been used for modeling various types of objects, and measuring similarity between them has been a key building block of a wide range of applications. However, as sets have grown in numbers and sizes, the computational cost and storage required for set similarity computation have become substantial. In this work, we propose SET2Box, which represents sets as boxes to precisely capture overlaps of sets and thus accurately estimate various similarity measures. Additionally, based on the proposed box quantization scheme, we design SET2Box+, which yields more concise but more accurate box representations of sets. Through extensive experiments on 8 real-world datasets, we show that, compared to baseline approaches, SET2Box+ is (a) Accurate: achieving up to $40.8\\times$ smaller estimation error while requiring 60% fewer bits to encode sets, (b) Concise: yielding up to $96.8\\times$ more concise representations with similar estimation error, and (c) Versatile: enabling the estimation of four set-similarity measures from a single representation of each set. For reproducibility, the source code and datasets used in the paper are available at https://github.com/geon0325/Set2Box.",

Hyperedges, which compose a hypergraph, are non-empty subsets of any number of nodes, and thus each hyperedge naturally represents a group interaction among entities. The higher-order nature of hypergraphs brings about unique structural properties that have not been considered in ordinary pairwise graphs. In this tutorial, we offer a comprehensive overview of a new research topic called hypergraph mining. We first present recently revealed structural properties of real-world hypergraphs, including (a) static and dynamic patterns, (b) global and local patterns, and (c) connectivity and overlapping patterns. Together with the patterns, we describe advanced data mining tools used for their discovery. Lastly, we introduce simple yet realistic hypergraph generative models that provide an explanation of the structural properties.",

            "abstract": "Sequences of group interactions, such as emails, online discussions, and co-authorships, are ubiquitous; and they are naturally represented as a stream of hyperedges (i.e., sets of nodes). Despite its broad potential applications, anomaly detection in hypergraphs (i.e., sets of hyperedges) has received surprisingly little attention, compared to anomaly detection in graphs. While it is tempting to reduce hypergraphs to graphs and apply existing graph-based methods, according to our experiments, taking higher-order structures of hypergraphs into consideration is worthwhile. We propose HashNWalk, an incremental algorithm that detects anomalies in a stream of hyperedges. It maintains and updates a constant-size summary of the structural and temporal information about the input stream. Using the summary, which is the form of a proximity matrix, HashNWalk measures the anomalousness of each new hyperedge as it appears. HashNWalk is (a) Fast: it processes each hyperedge in near real-time and billions of hyperedges within a few hours, (b) Space Efficient: the size of the maintained summary is a user-specific constant, (c) Effective: it successfully detects anomalous hyperedges in real-world hypergraphs.",

The flexibility in the number of nodes in each hyperedge, which provides the expressiveness of hypergraphs, brings about structural differences between graphs and hypergraphs. Especially, the overlaps of hyperedges lead to complex high-order relations beyond pairwise relations, raising new questions that have not been considered in graphs: How do hyperedges overlap in real-world hypergraphs? Are there any pervasive characteristics? What underlying process can cause such patterns? In this work, we closely investigate thirteen real-world hypergraphs from various domains and share interesting observations of the overlaps of hyperedges. To this end, we define principled measures and statistically compare the overlaps of hyperedges in real-world hypergraphs and those in null models. Additionally, based on the observations, we propose , a realistic hypergraph generative model. is (a) Realistic: it accurately reproduces overlapping patterns of real-world hypergraphs, (b) Automatically Fittable: its parameters can be tuned automatically using to generate hypergraphs particularly similar to a given target hypergraph, (c) Scalable: it generates and fits a hypergraph with 0.7 billion hyperedges within few hours.",

Given such temporal hypergraphs, how can we describe their underlying design principles? If their sizes and time spans are considerably different, how can we compare their structural and temporal characteristics? In this work, we define 96 temporal hypergraph motifs (TH-motifs), and propose the relative occurrences of their instances as an answer to the above questions. TH-motifs categorize the relational and temporal dynamics among three connected hyperedges that appear within a short time. For scalable analysis, we develop THYME+, a fast and exact algorithm for counting the instances of TH-motifs in massive hypergraphs, and show that THYME+ is at most ${2,163}\\times$ faster while requiring less space than baseline. Using it, we investigate 11 real-world temporal hypergraphs from various domains. We demonstrate that TH-motifs provide important information useful for downstream tasks and reveal interesting patterns, including the striking similarity between temporal hypergraphs from the same domain.",

            "abstract": "Complex relationships among entities can be modeled very effectively using hypergraphs. Hypergraphs model real-world data by allowing a hyperedge to include two or more entities. Clustering of hypergraphs enables us to group the similar entities together. While most existing algorithms solely consider the connection structure of a hypergraph to solve the clustering problem, we can boost the clustering performance by considering various features associated with the entities as well as auxiliary relationships among the entities. Also, we can further improve the clustering performance if some of the labels are known and we incorporate them into a clustering model. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised clustering framework for hypergraphs that is able to easily incorporate not only multiple relationships among the entities but also multiple attributes and content of the entities from diverse sources. Furthermore, by showing the close relationship between the hypergraph normalized cut and the weighted kernel K-Means, we also develop an efficient multilevel hypergraph clustering method which provides a good initialization with our semi-supervised multi-view clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm is effective in detecting the ground-truth clusters and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work, we propose tools for answering the following questions in a systematic manner: (Q1) what are structural design principles of real-world hypergraphs? (Q2) how can we compare local structures of hypergraphs of different sizes? (Q3) how can we identify domains which hypergraphs are from? We first define hypergraph motifs (h-motifs), which describe the connectivity patterns of three connected hyperedges. Then, we define the significance of each h-motif in a hypergraph as its occurrences relative to those in properly randomized hypergraphs. Lastly, we define the characteristic profile (CP) as the vector of the normalized significance of every h-motif. Regarding Q1, we find that h-motifs' occurrences in 11 real-world hypergraphs from 5 domains are clearly distinguished from those of randomized hypergraphs. In addition, we demonstrate that CPs capture local structural patterns unique to each domain, and thus comparing CPs of hypergraphs addresses Q2 and Q3. Our algorithmic contribution is to propose MoCHy, a family of parallel algorithms for counting h-motifs' occurrences in a hypergraph. We theoretically analyze their speed and accuracy, and we show empirically that the advanced approximate version MoCHy-A+ is up to 25X more accurate and 32X faster than the basic approximate and exact versions, respectively.",

The key idea of our modification is to introduce a relation perturbation while the original knowledge graph embedding models only corrupt entities when generating negative triplets in training.
