            "abstract": "Rumors can cause devastating consequences to individuals and our society. Analysis shows that the widespread of rumors typically results from deliberate promotion of information with unknown veracity aiming to shape the collective public opinions on the concerned news event. In this paper, we attempt to combat such chaotic phenomenon with a countermeasure by mirroring against how such chaos is created in order to make automatic rumor detection more robust and effective. Our idea is inspired by adversarial learning method originated from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We propose a GAN-style approach, where a generator is designed to produce uncertain or conflicting voices, further polarizing the original conversation threads with the intention of pressurizing the discriminator to learn stronger rumor indicative features from the augmented, more challenging examples. We reveal that feature learning effectiveness is highly relevant to the quality of generated parody, viz., how hard it is to get distinguished from real posts. Given the strong natural language generation performance of transformer, we propose a transformer-based method to improve the generated posts, so that they appear to be closely responsive to the source post and retain the authentic propagation structure and context of information. Different from traditional data-driven approach to rumor detection, our method can capture low-frequency but more salient non-trivial discriminant patterns via adversarial training. Extensive experiments on THREE benchmark datasets demonstrate that our rumor detection methods and the transformer-based model achieve much better results than state-of-the-art methods.",

To reverse such situation, we construct BEARD, a new Benchmark dataset for EARD, based on claims from fact-checking websites by trying to gather as many early relevant posts as possible. We also propose HEARD, a novel model based on neural Hawkes process for EARD, which can guide a generic rumor detection model to make timely, accurate and stable predictions.

The existence of such connections, which we call connected behavior, gives researchers a unique opportunity to predict how one would behave for a future event given their past behaviors.

Neural stance detection models are trained on Twitter data collected on three seemingly independent topics, i.e., wearing a mask, racial equality, and Trump, to detect people\u2019s stance, which we consider as their online behavior in each topic-related event. Our results reveal a strong connection between the stances toward the three topical events and demonstrate the power of past behaviors in predicting one\u2019s future behavior.",

Although promising results have been achieved, these models often suffer from slow inference or huge number of parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight fully convolutional architecture, called DialogConv, for response selection. DialogConv is exclusively built on top of convolution to extract matching features of context and response. Dialogues are modeled in 3D views, where DialogConv performs convolution operations on embedding view, word view and utterance view to capture richer semantic information from multiple contextual views. On the four benchmark datasets, compared with state-of-the-art baselines, DialogConv is on average about 8.5x smaller in size, and 79.39x and 10.64x faster on CPU and GPU devices, respectively. At the same time, DialogConv achieves the competitive effectiveness of response selection.",

            "abstract": "Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) has become an emerging research topic seeking to perform recommendations through interactive conversations, which generally consist of generation and recommendation modules. Prior work on CRS tends to incorporate more external and domain-specific knowledge like item reviews to enhance performance. Despite the fact that the collection and annotation of the external domain-specific information needs much human effort and degenerates the generalizability, too much extra knowledge introduces more difficulty to balance among them. Therefore, we propose to fully discover and extract internal knowledge from the context. We capture both entity-level and contextual-level representations to jointly model user preferences for the recommendation, where a time-aware attention is designed to emphasize the recently appeared items in entity-level representations. We further use the pre-trained BART to initialize the generation module to alleviate the data scarcity and enhance the context modeling. In addition to conducting experiments on a popular dataset (ReDial), we also include a multi-domain dataset (OpenDialKG) to show the effectiveness of our model. Experiments on both datasets show that our model achieves better performance on most evaluation metrics with less external knowledge and generalizes well to other domains. Additional analyses on the recommendation and generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in different scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The diffusion of rumors on social media generally follows a propagation tree structure, which provides valuable clues on how an original message is transmitted and responded by users over time. Recent studies reveal that rumor verification and stance detection are two relevant tasks that can jointly enhance each other despite their differences. For example, rumors can be debunked by cross-checking the stances conveyed by their relevant posts, and stances are also conditioned on the nature of the rumor. However, stance detection typically requires a large training set of labeled stances at post level, which are rare and costly to annotate. Enlightened by Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) scheme, we propose a novel weakly supervised joint learning framework for rumor verification and stance detection which only requires bag-level class labels concerning the rumor's veracity. Specifically, based on the propagation trees of source posts, we convert the two multi-class problems into multiple MIL-based binary classification problems where each binary model is focused on differentiating a target class (of rumor or stance) from the remaining classes. Then, we propose a hierarchical attention mechanism to aggregate the binary predictions, including (1) a bottom-up/top-down tree attention layer to aggregate binary stances into binary veracity; and (2) a discriminative attention layer to aggregate the binary class into finer-grained classes. Extensive experiments conducted on three Twitter-based datasets demonstrate promising performance of our model on both claim-level rumor detection and post-level stance classification compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "In open-domain dialogue systems, knowledge information such as unstructured persona profiles, text descriptions and structured knowledge graph can help incorporate abundant background facts for delivering more engaging and informative responses. Existing studies attempted to model a general posterior distribution over candidate knowledge by considering the entire response utterance as a whole at the beginning of decoding process for knowledge selection. However, a single smooth distribution could fail to model the variability of knowledge selection patterns over different decoding steps, and make the knowledge expression less consistent. To remedy this issue, we propose an adaptive posterior knowledge selection framework, which sequentially introduces a series of discriminative distributions to dynamically control when and what knowledge should be used in specific decoding steps. The adaptive distributions can also capture knowledge-relevant semantic dependencies between adjacent words to refine response generation. In particular, for knowledge graph-grounded dialogue generation, we further incorporate the adaptive distributions into generative word distributions to help express the knowledge entity words. The experimental results show that our developed methods outperform strong baseline systems by large margins.",
