            "abstract": "In this paper, we provide an overview of current technologies for cross-lingual link discovery, and we discuss challenges, experiences and prospects of their application to under-resourced languages. We rst introduce the goals of cross-lingual linking and associated technologies, and in particular, the role that the Linked Data paradigm (Bizer et al., 2011) applied to language data can play in this context. We de ne under-resourced languages with a speci c focus on languages actively used on the internet, i.e., languages with a digitally versatile speaker community, but limited support in terms of language technology. We argue that languages for which considerable amounts of textual data and (at least) a bilingual word list are available, techniques for cross-lingual linking can be readily applied, and that these enable the implementation of downstream applications for under-resourced languages via the localisation and adaptation of existing technologies and resources.",

In the end, we provide a baseline functionality that uses the connection of two web services \u2013 a SPARQL end point for multilingual lexical data and another SPARQL end point for querying an English language knowledge graph \u2013 in order to perform querying an English language knowledge graph using foreign language labels.

Today, the use of the synonymy module of METEOR is only exploited when English is the target language (use of WordNet). A synonymy module using DBnary would allow its use for the 21 languages (covered up to now) as target languages. The code of this new instance of METEOR, adapted to several target languages, is provided to the community via a github repository. We also show that our DBnary augmented METEOR increases the correlation with human judgements on the WMT 2013 and 2014 metrics dataset for English-to-(French, Russian, German, Spanish) language pairs.",

In natural language processing, lexico-semantic resources are used in many applications. The manual creation of such resources is very time consuming and their limited coverage does not always satisfy the needs of applications. This problem is further exacerbated with lesser resourced languages. However, in that context, Word Sense Induction (WSI) offers an interesting avenue towards a solution. The purpose of WSI is, from a text corpus, to infer the possible senses for each word contained therein. In this paper, we study an approach based on a vectorial representation of the cooccurrence of word with their neighbours across each usage context. We first build the vectorial representation on a Bangla (also known as Bengali) corpus and then apply and compare three clustering algorithms (k-Means, Hierarchical Clustering and Expectation Maximisation) that elicit clusters corresponding to the different senses of each word as used within a corpus. We wanted to use Bangla WordNet to evaluate the clusters, however, the coverage of Bangla WordNet being restrictive compared to Princeton WordNet ( 23.65%), we find that the clustering algorithms induce correct senses that are not present in Bangla WordNet. Therefore we created a gold standard that we manually extended to include the senses not covered in Bangla WordNet.",

            "abstract": "The DBnary project aims at providing high quality Lexical Linked Data extracted from different Wiktionary language editions. Data from 10 different languages is currently extracted for a total of over 3.16M translation links that connect lexical entries from the 10 extracted languages, to entries in more than one thousand languages. In Wiktionary, glosses are often associated with translations to help users understand to what sense they refer to, whether through a textual definition or a target sense number. In this article we aim at the extraction of as much of this information as possible and then the disambiguation of the corresponding translations for all languages available. We use an adaptation of various textual and semantic similarity techniques based on partial or fuzzy gloss overlaps to disambiguate the translation relations (To account for the lack of normalization, e.g. lemmatization and PoS tagging) and then extract some of the sense number information present to build a gold standard so as to evaluate our disambiguation as well as tune and optimize the parameters of the similarity measures. We obtain F-measures of the order of 80\\% (on par with similar work on English only), across the three languages where we could generate a gold standard (French, Portuguese, Finnish) and show that most of the disambiguation errors are due to inconsistencies in Wiktionary itself that cannot be detected at the generation of DBnary (shifted sense numbers, inconsistent glosses, etc.).",

DBnary is a RDF dataset, structured using the LEMON vocabulary, that is extracted from twelve different Wiktionary language editions.
