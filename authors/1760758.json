            "abstract": "When a link is not explicitly present in an RDF dataset, it does not mean that the link could not exist in reality. Link prediction methods try to overcome this problem by finding new links in the dataset with support of a background knowledge about the already existing links in the dataset. In dynamic environments that change often and evolve over time, link prediction methods should also take into account the temporal aspects of data. In this paper, we present a novel time-aware link prediction method. We model RDF data as a tensor and take into account the time when RDF data was created. We use an ageing function to model a retention of the information over the time; lower the significance of the older information and promote more recent. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method improves quality of predictions when compared with methods that do not consider the time information.",

            "abstract": "a b s t r a c t Service-oriented computing has brought special attention to service description, especially in connection with semantic technologies. The expected proliferation of publicly accessible services can benefit greatly from tool support and automation, both of which are the focus of Semantic Web Service (SWS) frameworks that especially address service discovery, composition and execution. As the first SWS standard, in 2007 the World Wide Web Consortium produced a lightweight bottom-up specification called SAWSDL for adding semantic annotations to WSDL service descriptions. Building on SAWSDL, this article presents WSMO-Lite, a lightweight ontology of Web service semantics that distinguishes four semantic aspects of services: function, behavior, information model, and nonfunctional properties, which together form a basis for semantic automation. With the WSMO-Lite ontology, SAWSDL descriptions enable semantic automation beyond simple input/output matchmaking that is supported by SAWSDL itself. Further, to broaden the reach of WSMO-Lite and SAWSDL tools to the increasingly common RESTful services, the article adds hRESTS and MicroWSMO, two HTML microformats that mirror WSDL and SAWSDL in the documentation of RESTful services, enabling combining RESTful services with WSDL-based ones in a single semantic framework. To demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of this approach, the article presents common algorithms for Web service discovery and composition adapted to WSMO-Lite.",

            "abstract": "Cloud Computing is an elastic execution environment becoming the dominating solution for scalable and on-demand computing, and a large market of cloud providers has recently emerged. IaaS is a realisation of the Cloud Computing at the level of processing, storage and networking resources. Currently, users lack a consolidated view of the IaaS market and it is time-consuming and cumbersome to identify the most suitable IaaS offers. IaaS services are highly configurable and their properties are often request-dependent and change dynamically. In this paper we introduce a service matchmaking approach for IaaS. We present models to define expressive search requests and IaaS descriptions which are grounded in lightweight semantic formalisms of RDF and SPARQL, and use Linked Data. Our approach supports dynamic generation of IaaS offers, and their filtering and ranking. We provide a proof-of-concept matchmaker operating on expressive search requests and descriptions of nineteen IaaS services including: Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, ElasticHosts, CloudSigma, and Joyent-Cloud.",

However, service consumers are mainly interested in concrete, consumable service offers which are specified using concrete values of service attributes. Service offers, due to their request dependence and dynamicity, have to be generated on-the-fly what may require interaction with a service. We propose a service description model that facilitates creation of consumable service offers. A large number of service offers can be generated considering flexible search requests. In order to address that, we propose a novel approach to dynamic generation of service offers. Our approach is based on genetic algorithms and reduces the number of relevant service offers. For evaluation purposes we apply our approach to the shipping domain where real shipping services on the Web are used to prove the effectiveness and usability of our approach in a real-world domain.",

We define search request model that include hard constraints, rich preferences, and flexible input parameters. We use a combination of utility functions and weighted rules for modeling rich preferences.

            "abstract": "Web services, both RESTful and WSDL-based, are an increasingly important part of the Web. With the application of semantic technologies, we can achieve automation of the use of those services. In this paper, we present WSMO-Lite and MicroWSMO, two related lightweight approaches to semantic Web service description, evolved from the WSMO framework. WSMO-Lite uses SAWSDL to annotate WSDL-based services, whereas MicroWSMO uses the hRESTS microformat to annotate RESTful APIs and services. Both frameworks share an ontology for service semantics together with most of automation algorithms.",
