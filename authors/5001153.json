            "title": "Body Measurement Prediction Fairness",
            "abstract": "E-Commerce size and fit recommendations can be improved by using customer images to estimate body measurements. We are developing a body measurement fairness evaluation to determine if Zalando\u2019s AI/ML driven body measurement pipelines systematically underperform for customers of certain gender, body shape, or skin tone. The fairness evaluation produces four unfairness scores. The first is a gender unfairness score: the difference in average performance between genders. The second and third are body shape and skin tone unfairness scores: the difference in average performance between smallest and largest bodies, and lightest and deepest skin tones, respectively. The fourth is an intersectional unfairness score: the number of customers that are members of clusters associated with significant underperformance. We demonstrate the fairness pipeline on one body measurement pipeline candidate in the development stage showing that body shape receives the most significant unfairness score. This work allows us to catch unfair body measurement pipelines during experimentation and development stages to help our team avoid deploying unfair models into production.",
