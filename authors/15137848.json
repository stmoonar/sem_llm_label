            "title": "A Two-Stage Strategy for UAV-Enabled Wireless Power Transfer in Unknown Environments",
            "abstract": "Due to the outstanding merits such as mobility, high maneuverability, and flexibility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are viable mobile power transmitters that can be rapidly deployed in geographically constrained regions. They are good candidates for supplying power to energy-limited Sensor Nodes (SNs) with Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology. In this paper, we investigate a UAV-enabled WPT system that transmits power to a set of SNs at unknown positions. A key challenge is how to efficiently gather the locations of SNs and design a power transfer scheme. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly optimize these objectives: maximization of UAV's search efficiency, maximization of total harvested energy, minimization of UAV's flight energy consumption and maximization of UAV's energy utilization efficiency. To tackle these issues, we present a two-stage strategy that includes a UAV Motion Control (UMC) algorithm for obtaining the coordinates of SNs and a Dynamic Genetic Clustering (DGC) algorithm for power transfer via grouping SNs into clusters. First, the UMC algorithm enables the UAV to autonomously control its own motion and conduct target search missions. The objective is to make the energy-restricted UAV find as many SNs as feasible without any priori known location information. Second, the DGC algorithm is used to optimize the energy consumption of the UAV by combining a genetic clustering algorithm with a dynamic clustering strategy to maximize the amount of energy harvested by SNs and the energy utilization efficiency of the UAV. Finally, experimental results show that our proposed algorithms outperform their counterparts.",

            "title": "Anti-Time-Delay Repeater Jamming under Sea Surface Target Spatial Position Constraint",
            "abstract": "Aiming at the problem of time-delay repeater jamming in the sea surface target detection environment, it is difficult for radar to discriminate false targets from the time domain and frequency domain. This paper proposes an anti-time-delay repeater jamming method based on spatial position constraint. The spatial position constraint method is a good candidate, which combines the radar\u2019s position obtained by radar altimeter with the target\u2019s angle obtained by amplitude-comparison angle measurement, and then solves the desired range of the target. In the multi-target tracking mode, by comparing the measured range of the detected target with the expected range under the spatial constraint, it can be judged whether the target is located on the sea surface, thereby determining the target position and the trajectory, and eliminating the time-delay repeater jamming. By analyzing the radius of the spatial error region caused by the angle error and the delay corresponding to the radius, the obtained correlation threshold can as an assistant to discriminate the false target. This method reduces complicated signal processing and avoids excessive computation. The simulation results show that the proposed method can easily and effectively eliminate the time-delay repeater jamming and obtain the target position.",
