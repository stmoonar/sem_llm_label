            "title": "From Large Language Models to Databases and Back: A Discussion on Research and Education",
            "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention from both academia and industry due to their potential to facilitate natural language processing (NLP) and generate highquality text. Despite their benefits, however, the use of LLMs is raising concerns about the reliability of knowledge extraction. The combination of DB research and data science has advanced the state of the art in solving real-world problems, such as merchandise recommendation and hazard prevention [30]. In this discussion, we explore the challenges and opportunities related to LLMs in DB and data science research and education.",

            "abstract": "With the development of the internet, online education platforms have become the main means of acquiring knowledge for people. To improve the efficiency of user analysis, this paper proposes a framework for user sentiment recognition based on course review information of online education platforms. Firstly, according to the characteristics of the review data of online platforms, the authors use crawlers and open-source word separation tools to complete data collection and collation; secondly, the authors use TextCNN (text convolutional neural networks) and BILSTM (bi-long-short-term-memory) to combine to build a feature layer fusion text sentiment classification model. The results show that the average precision of the model built is 95.1% for the three sentiment classifications. Finally, a test of the reviews of new courses on online education platforms is conducted. The sentiment recognition rate of all three types of new courses exceeds 90%. Therefore, the proposed model provides new ideas for user analysis.",
