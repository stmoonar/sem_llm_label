            "abstract": "Accurate alignment of calcium imaging data, which is critical for the extraction of neuronal activity signals, is often hindered by the image noise and the neuronal activity itself. To address the problem, we propose an algorithm named REALS for robust and efficient batch image alignment through simultaneous transformation and low rank and sparse decomposition. REALS is constructed upon our finding that the low rank subspace can be recovered via linear projection, which allows us to perform simultaneous image alignment and decomposition with gradient-based updates. REALS achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in terms of accuracy and speed compared to the state-of-the-art robust image alignment algorithms.",

            "title": "Optical and computational approaches for mapping brain activity and structure",
            "abstract": "Neuroscience always has been a heavily\ntechnology-starved field that has been often revolutionized with\nthe rise of a new technology; and arguably the future advancement\nof neuroscience will also depend largely on the development of new\ntechnologies that allow acquiring new data sets that can provide\ndeeper insights into the brain. While there is no universal\nagreement as to what data sets are needed to fully reveal the\nunderlying principles of brain computation, neurons will certainly\nserve as an important layer to study the brain considering their\ndiscreteness and electrical characteristics. In other words, seeing\na brain as a circuitry that is made of the neurons, it is important\nto study the relation between the brain's structure and its\nfunction at the neuronal level. Unfortunately, a brain is a huge\nnetwork that consists of a huge number of neurons which makes it\ndifficult to see the \"big picture\" while retaining the single\nneuron resolution. The aim of this study is to the develop such\ntechnologies that allow to see and analyze the large network's\nstructure and dynamics with the single neuron resolution. The core\nstrategy is to use optical microscopy to acquire the raw data and\nto infer the information of our interests with computational\ntechniques with designing both optical and computational parts with\neach other in mind to maximize the synergy. The first part of the\nthesis describes the development and application of computational\nimaging techniques to monitor the brain activity in 3-D which\nallowed us to see how the neurons interact at an unprecedented\nspeed. The second part describes a computational approach to\nextract a wiring diagram of a brain from an optical image of the\nbrain rather than an electron microscopy image, as optical\nmicroscopy is undergoing rapid development and is likely to\noutperform electron microscopy in terms of scalability which will\nbe an important criterion to map the whole brain. These will be the\ntools of great utility in neuroscience that can generate rich data\nsets that will be of wide interests to system neuroscientists as\nwell as cellular/molecular neuroscientists.",

            "abstract": "We here introduce and study the properties, via computer simulation, of a candidate automated approach to algorithmic reconstruction of dense neural morphology, based on simulated data of the kind that would be obtained via two emerging molecular technologies\u2014expansion microscopy (ExM) and in-situ molecular barcoding. We utilize a convolutional neural network to detect neuronal boundaries from protein-tagged plasma membrane images obtained via ExM, as well as a subsequent supervoxel-merging pipeline guided by optical readout of information-rich, cell-specific nucleic acid barcodes. We attempt to use conservative imaging and labeling parameters, with the goal of establishing a baseline case that points to the potential feasibility of optical circuit reconstruction, leaving open the possibility of higher-performance labeling technologies and algorithms. We find that, even with these conservative assumptions, an all-optical approach to dense neural morphology reconstruction may be possible via the proposed algorithmic framework. Future work should explore both the design-space of chemical labels and barcodes, as well as algorithms, to ultimately enable routine, high-performance optical circuit reconstruction.",
