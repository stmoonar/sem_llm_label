            "title": "Sublinear-Time Opinion Estimation in the Friedkin--Johnsen Model",
            "abstract": "Online social networks are ubiquitous parts of modern societies and the discussions that take place in these networks impact people's opinions on diverse topics, such as politics or vaccination. One of the most popular models to formally describe this opinion formation process is the Friedkin--Johnsen (FJ) model, which allows to define measures, such as the polarization and the disagreement of a network. Recently, Xu, Bao and Zhang (WebConf'21) showed that all opinions and relevant measures in the FJ model can be approximated in near-linear time. However, their algorithm requires the entire network and the opinions of all nodes as input. Given the sheer size of online social networks and increasing data-access limitations, obtaining the entirety of this data might, however, be unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we show that node opinions and all relevant measures, like polarization and disagreement, can be efficiently approximated in time that is sublinear in the size of the network. Particularly, our algorithms only require query-access to the network and do not have to preprocess the graph. Furthermore, we use a connection between FJ opinion dynamics and personalized PageRank, and show that in d-regular graphs, we can deterministically approximate each node's opinion by only looking at a constant-size neighborhood, independently of the network size. We also experimentally validate that our estimation algorithms perform well in practice.",

            "title": "Modeling the Impact of Timeline Algorithms on Opinion Dynamics Using Low-rank Updates",
            "abstract": "Timeline algorithms are key parts of online social networks, but during recent years they have been blamed for increasing polarization and disagreement in our society. Opinion-dynamics models have been used to study a variety of phenomena in online social networks, but an open question remains on how thesemodels can be augmented to take into account the fine-grained impact of user-level timeline algorithms. We make progress on this question by providing a way to model the impact of timeline algorithms on opinion dynamics. Specifically, we show how the popular Friedkin--Johnsen opinion-formation model can be augmented based on aggregate information, extracted from timeline data. We use our model to study the problem of minimizing the polarization and disagreement; we assume that we are allowed to make small changes to the users' timeline compositions by strengthening some topics of discussion and penalizing some others. We present a gradient descent-based algorithm for this problem, and show that under realistic parameter settings, our algorithm computes a (1+\\varepsilon)-approximate solution in time~\\tO(m\\sqrtn \u0142g(1/\\varepsilon)), where m~is the number of edges in the graph and n~is the number of vertices. We also present an algorithm that provably computes an \\varepsilon-approximation of our model in near-linear time. We evaluate our method on real-world data and show that it effectively reduces the polarization and disagreement in the network. Finally, we release an anonymized graph dataset with ground-truth opinions and more than 27\\,000~nodes (the previously largest publicly available dataset contains less than 550~nodes).",
