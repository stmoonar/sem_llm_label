            "title": "Geo-Llama: Leveraging LLMs for Human Mobility Trajectory Generation with Spatiotemporal Constraints",
            "abstract": "Simulating human mobility data is essential for various application domains, including transportation, urban planning, and epidemic control, since real data are often inaccessible to researchers due to expensive costs and privacy issues. Several existing deep generative solutions propose learning from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with growing data size. More importantly, they generally lack control mechanisms to steer the generated trajectories based on spatiotemporal constraints such as fixing specific visits. To address such limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem with spatiotemporal constraints and propose Geo-Llama. This novel LLM-inspired framework enforces explicit visit constraints in a contextually coherent way. It fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on trajectories with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a time and location. This enables the model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders and allows flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.",

            "abstract": "Understanding human mobility patterns is crucial for urban planning, resource allocation, and personalized recommendations. However, real-world trajectory data are rarely released publicly due to privacy concerns. At the same time, metropolitan cities are becoming equipped with various roadside sensors, such as CCTV cameras and RFIDs. Unlike trajectory data, these sensors do not uniquely identify and track vehicles, making extracting mobility patterns from their detections challenging. In this paper, we propose VPE, a framework that processes roadside sensor observations to estimate the probability that a vehicle visits a road segment at a certain time. At the core of VPE, we implement LEM, a novel mathematical model that calculates location transition probabilities taking into account the sensors\u2019 reliability. Lastly, we propose APD+, an algorithm that captures the uncertainty of movement between two endpoints. Our experiments show that the proposed methods achieve high accuracy while maintaining practical computation time.",

Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy.

            "abstract": "Encoding geospatial data is crucial for enabling machine learning (ML) models to perform tasks that require spatial reasoning, such as identifying the topological relationships between two different geospatial objects. However, existing encoding methods are limited as they are typically customized to handle only specific types of spatial data, which impedes their applicability across different downstream tasks where multiple data types coexist. To address this, we introduce Poly2Vec, an encoding framework that unifies the modeling of different geospatial objects, including 2D points, polylines, and polygons, irrespective of the downstream task. We leverage the power of the 2D Fourier transform to encode useful spatial properties, such as shape and location, from geospatial objects into fixed-length vectors. These vectors are then inputted into neural network models for spatial reasoning tasks.This unified approach eliminates the need to develop and train separate models for each distinct spatial type. We evaluate Poly2Vec on both synthetic and real datasets of mixed geometry types and verify its consistent performance across several downstream spatial reasoning tasks.",
