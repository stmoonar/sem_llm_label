            "title": "Autoencoder based Anomaly Detection and Explained Fault Localization in Industrial Cooling Systems",
            "abstract": "Anomaly detection in large industrial cooling systems is very challenging due to the high data dimensionality, inconsistent sensor recordings, and lack of labels. The state of the art for automated anomaly detection in these systems typically relies on expert knowledge and thresholds. However, data is viewed isolated and complex, multivariate relationships are neglected. In this work, we present an autoencoder based end-to-end workflow for anomaly detection suitable for multivariate time series data in large industrial cooling systems, including explained fault localization and root cause analysis based on expert knowledge. We identify system failures using a threshold on the total reconstruction error (autoencoder reconstruction error including all sensor signals). For fault localization, we compute the individual reconstruction error (autoencoder reconstruction error for each sensor signal) allowing us to identify the signals that contribute most to the total reconstruction error. Expert knowledge is provided via look-up table enabling root-cause analysis and assignment to the affected subsystem. We demonstrated our findings in a cooling system unit including 34 sensors over a 8-months\u2019 time period using 4-fold cross validation approaches and automatically created labels based on thresholds provided by domain experts. Using 4-fold cross validation, we reached a F1-score of 0.56, whereas the autoencoder results showed a higher consistency score (CS of 0.92) compared to the automatically created labels (CS of 0.62) \u2013 indicating that theanomaly is recognized in a very stable manner. The automatically created labels, however, detected anomaly earlier. The main anomaly was found by the autoencoder and automatically created labels, and was also recorded in the log files. Further, the explained fault localization highlighted the most affected component for the main anomaly in a very consistent manner.",

            "abstract": ". In distributional reinforcement learning, the entire distribution of the return instead of just the expected return is modeled. The approach with categorical distributions as the approximation method is well-known in Q-learning, and convergence results have been established in the tabular case. In this work, speedy Q-learning is extended to categorical distributions, a finite-time analysis is performed, and probably approximately correct bounds in terms of the Cram\u00b4er distance are established. It is shown that also in the distributional case the new update rule yields faster policy evaluation in comparison to the standard Q-learning one and that the sample complexity is essentially the same as the one of the value-based algorithmic counterpart. Without the need for more state-action-reward samples, one gains significantly more information about the return with categorical distributions. Even though the results do not easily extend to the case of policy control, a slight modification to the update rule yields promising numerical results.",

            "abstract": "In this work, a method for automatic hyper-parameter tuning of the stacked asymmetric auto-encoder is proposed. In previous work, the deep learning ability to extract personality perception from speech was shown, but hyper-parameter tuning was attained by trial-and-error, which is time-consuming and requires machine learning knowledge. Therefore, obtaining hyper-parameter values is challenging and places limits on deep learning usage. To address this challenge, researchers have applied optimization methods. Although there were successes, the search space is very large due to the large number of deep learning hyper-parameters, which increases the probability of getting stuck in local optima. Researchers have also focused on improving global optimization methods. In this regard, we suggest a novel global optimization method based on the cultural algorithm, multi-island and the concept of parallelism to search this large space smartly. At first, we evaluated our method on three well-known optimization benchmarks and compared the results with recently published papers. Results indicate that the convergence of the proposed method speeds up due to the ability to escape from local optima, and the precision of the results improves dramatically. Afterward, we applied our method to optimize five hyper-parameters of an asymmetric auto-encoder for automatic personality perception. Since inappropriate hyper-parameters lead the network to over-fitting and under-fitting, we used a novel cost function to prevent over-fitting and under-fitting. As observed, the unweighted average recall (accuracy) was improved by 6.52% (9.54%) compared to our previous work and had remarkable outcomes compared to other published personality perception works.",

The performance of a machine learning algorithm is highly sensitive to the choice of its hyperparameters. In an FL setting, hyperparameter optimization poses new challenges. In this work, we investigated the impact of different hyperparameter optimization approaches in an FL system. In an effort to reduce communication costs, a critical bottleneck in FL, we investigated a local hyperparameter optimization approach that -- in contrast to a global hyperparameter optimization approach -- allows every client to have its own hyperparameter configuration. We implemented these approaches based on grid search and Bayesian optimization and evaluated the algorithms on the MNIST data set using an i.i.d. partition and on an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor based industrial data set using a non-i.i.d. partition.",

We proceed to develop a numerical strategy to compute cubature formulas that exploit permutation-invariance properties related to multisymmetry groups in order to reduce computational work.

            "abstract": "This work addresses the development of an optimal computational scheme for the approximation of the first-order corrector arising in the stochastic homogenization of linear elliptic PDEs in divergence form. Equations of this type describe, for example, diffusion phenomena in materials with a heterogeneous microstructure, but require enormous computational efforts in order to obtain reliable results. We derive an optimization problem for the needed computational work with a given error tolerance, then extract the governing parameters from numerical experiments, and finally solve the obtained optimization problem. The numerical approach investigated here is a stochastic sampling scheme for the probability space connected with a finite-element method for the discretization of the physical space.",
