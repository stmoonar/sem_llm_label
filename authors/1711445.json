            "abstract": "We demonstrate the Patterns of Life Simulation to create realistic simulations of human mobility in a city. This simulation has recently been used to generate massive amounts of trajectory and check-in data. Our demonstration focuses on using the simulation twofold: (1) using the graphical user interface (GUI), and (2) running the simulation headless by disabling the GUI for faster data generation. We further demonstrate how the Patterns of Life simulation can be used to simulate any region on Earth by using publicly available data from OpenStreetMap. Finally, we also demonstrate recent improvements to the scalability of the simulation allows simulating up to 100,000 individual agents for years of simulation time. During our demonstration, as well as offline using our guides on GitHub, participants will learn: (1) The theories of human behavior driving the Patters of Life simulation, (2) how to simulate to generate massive amounts of synthetic yet realistic trajectory data, (3) running the simulation for a region of interest chosen by participants using OSM data, (4) learn the scalability of the simulation and understand the properties of generated data, and (5) manage thousands of parallel simulation instances running concurrently.",

            "title": "In Silico Human Mobility Data Science: Leveraging Massive Simulated Mobility Data (Vision Paper)",
            "abstract": "Human mobility data science using trajectories or check-ins of individuals has many applications. Recently, we have seen a plethora of research efforts that tackle these applications. However, research progress in this field is limited by a lack of large and representative datasets. The largest and most commonly used dataset of individual human trajectories captures fewer than 200 individuals, while datasets of individual human check-ins capture fewer than 100 check-ins per city per day. Thus, it is not clear if findings from the human mobility data science community would generalize to large populations. Since obtaining massive, representative, and individual-level human mobility data is hard to come by due to privacy considerations, the vision of this work is to embrace the use of data generated by large-scale socially realistic microsimulations. Informed by both real data and leveraging social and behavioral theories, massive spatially explicit microsimulations may allow us to simulate entire megacities at the person level. The simulated worlds, which do not capture any identifiable personal information, allow us to perform \u201cin silico\u201d experiments using the simulated world as a sandbox in which we have perfect information and perfect control without jeopardizing the privacy of any actual individual. In silico experiments have become commonplace in other scientific domains such as chemistry and biology, permitting experiments that foster the understanding of concepts without any harm to individuals. This work describes challenges and opportunities for leveraging massive and realistic simulated alternate worlds for in silico human mobility data science.",

            "abstract": "Merge trees are a valuable tool in the scientific visualization of scalar fields; however, current methods for merge tree comparisons are computationally expensive, primarily due to the exhaustive matching between tree nodes. To address this challenge, we introduce the Merge Tree Neural Network (MTNN), a learned neural network model designed for merge tree comparison. The MTNN enables rapid and high-quality similarity computation. We first demonstrate how to train graph neural networks, which emerged as effective encoders for graphs, in order to produce embeddings of merge trees in vector spaces for efficient similarity comparison. Next, we formulate the novel MTNN model that further improves the similarity comparisons by integrating the tree and node embeddings with a new topological attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on real-world data in different domains and examine our model's generalizability across various datasets. Our experimental analysis demonstrates our approach's superiority in accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we speed up the prior state-of-the-art by more than 100\u00d7 on the benchmark datasets while maintaining an error rate below 0.1%.",

In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Individual human location trajectory and check-in data have been the driving force for human mobility research in recent years. However, existing human mobility datasets are very limited in size and representativeness. For example, one of the largest and most commonly used datasets of individual human location trajectories, GeoLife, captures fewer than two hundred individuals. To help fill this gap, this Data and Resources paper leverages an existing data generator based on fine-grained simulation of individual human patterns of life to produce large-scale trajectory, check-in, and social network data. In this simulation, individual human agents commute between their home and work locations, visit restaurants to eat, and visit recreational sites to meet friends. We provide large datasets of months of simulated trajectories for two example regions in the United States: San Francisco and New Orleans. In addition to making the datasets available, we also provide instructions on how the simulation can be used to re-generate data, thus allowing researchers to generate the data locally without downloading prohibitively large files.",

More recently, the Frechet distance has been generalized to a distance between two copies of the same graph embedded or immersed in a metric space; this more general setting opens up a wide range of more complex applications in graph analysis. In this paper, we initiate a study of some of the fundamental topological properties of spaces of paths and of graphs mapped to R^n under the Frechet distance, in an effort to lay the theoretical groundwork for understanding how these distances can be used in practice. In particular, we prove whether or not these spaces, and the metric balls therein, are path-connected.",

            "title": "Visualizing Topological Importance: A Class-Driven Approach",
            "abstract": "This paper presents the first approach to visualize the importance of topological features that define classes of data. Topological features, with their ability to abstract the fundamental structure of complex data, are an integral component of visualization and analysis pipelines. Although not all topological features present in data are of equal importance. To date, the default definition of feature importance is often assumed and fixed. This work shows how proven explainable deep learning approaches can be adapted for use in topological classification. In doing so, it provides the first technique that illuminates what topological structures are important in each dataset in regards to their class label. In particular, the approach uses a learned metric classifier with a density estimator of the points of a persistence diagram as input. This metric learns how to reweigh this density such that classification accuracy is high. By extracting this weight, an importance field on persistent point density can be created. This provides an intuitive representation of persistence point importance that can be used to drive new visualizations. This work provides two examples: Visualization on each diagram directly and, in the case of sublevel set filtrations on images, directly on the images themselves. This work highlights real-world examples of this approach visualizing the important topological features in graph, 3D shape, and medical image data.",

            "abstract": "A geometric graph is a combinatorial graph, endowed with a geometry that is inherited from its embedding in a Euclidean space. Formulation of a meaningful measure of (dis-)similarity in both the combinatorial and geometric structures of two such geometric graphs is a challenging problem in pattern recognition. We study two notions of distance measures for geometric graphs, called the geometric edit distance (GED) and geometric graph distance (GGD). While the former is based on the idea of editing one graph to transform it into the other graph, the latter is inspired by inexact matching of the graphs. For decades, both notions have been lending themselves well as measures of similarity between attributed graphs. If used without any modification, however, they fail to provide a meaningful distance measure for geometric graphs -- even cease to be a metric. We have curated their associated cost functions for the context of geometric graphs. Alongside studying the metric properties of GED and GGD, we investigate how the two notions compare. We further our understanding of the computational aspects of GGD by showing that the distance is $\\mathcal{NP}$-hard to compute, even if the graphs are planar and arbitrary cost coefficients are allowed.",

            "abstract": "Persistence diagrams have been widely used to quantify the underlying features of filtered topological spaces in data visualization. In many applications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however, computing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a binary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast computation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning process. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into binary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training of this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from synthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is directly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the model. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better maintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other vectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to the problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of our approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of our approach on a dataset with 10k persistence diagrams, which is not possible with current techniques. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that our method is significantly faster with the potential of less memory usage, while retaining comparable or better quality comparisons.",
