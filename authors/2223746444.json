            "title": "Beyond Two-Tower Matching: Learning Sparse Retrievable Cross-Interactions for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Two-tower models are a prevalent matching framework for recommendation, which have been widely deployed in industrial applications. The success of two-tower matching attributes to its efficiency in retrieval among a large number of items, since the item tower can be precomputed and used for fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search. However, it suffers two main challenges, including limited feature interaction capability and reduced accuracy in online serving. Existing approaches attempt to design novel late interactions instead of dot products, but they still fail to support complex feature interactions or lose retrieval efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a new matching paradigm named SparCode, which supports not only sophisticated feature interactions but also efficient retrieval. Specifically, SparCode introduces an all-to-all interaction module to model fine-grained query-item interactions. Besides, we design a discrete code-based sparse inverted index jointly trained with the model to achieve effective and efficient model inference. Extensive experiments have been conducted on open benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our framework. The results show that SparCode significantly improves the accuracy of candidate item matching while retaining the same level of retrieval efficiency with two-tower models.",

            "title": "Diffusion Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SRS) has become the technical foundation in many applications recently, which aims to recommend the next item based on the user's historical interactions. However, sequential recommendation often faces the problem of data sparsity, which widely exists in recommender systems. Besides, most users only interact with a few items, but existing SRS models often underperform these users. Such a problem, named the long-tail user problem, is still to be resolved. Data augmentation is a distinct way to alleviate these two problems, but they often need fabricated training strategies or are hindered by poor-quality generated interactions. To address these problems, we propose a Diffusion Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation (DiffuASR) for a higher quality generation. The augmented dataset by DiffuASR can be used to train the sequential recommendation models directly, free from complex training procedures. To make the best of the generation ability of the diffusion model, we first propose a diffusion-based pseudo sequence generation framework to fill the gap between image and sequence generation. Then, a sequential U-Net is designed to adapt the diffusion noise prediction model U-Net to the discrete sequence generation task. At last, we develop two guide strategies to assimilate the preference between generated and origin sequences. To validate the proposed DiffuASR, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets with three sequential recommendation models. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of DiffuASR. As far as we know, DiffuASR is one pioneer that introduce the diffusion model to the recommendation.The implementation code is available online.",

            "abstract": "CTR prediction is critical to industrial recommender systems. Recently, with the growth of business domains in enterprises, much attention has been focused on the multi-domain CTR recommendation. Numerous models have been proposed that attempt to use a unified model to serve multiple domains. Although much progress has been made, we argue that they ignore the importance of feature interactions and user behaviors when modeling cross-domain relations, which is a coarse-grained utilizing of domain information. To solve this problem, we propose Domain Facilitated Feature Modeling (DFFM) for CTR prediction. It incorporates domain-related information into the parameters of the feature interaction and user behavior modules, allowing for domain-specific learning of these two aspects. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of DFFM. We deploy the DFFM model in Huawei advertising platform and gain a 4.13% improvement of revenue on a two week online A/B test. Currently DFFM model has been used as the main traffic model, serving for hundreds of millions of people.",

            "abstract": "Multi-Domain Recommendation (MDR) has gained significant attention in recent years, which leverages data from multiple domains to enhance their performance concurrently. However, current MDR models are confronted with two limitations. Firstly, the majority of these models adopt an approach that explicitly shares parameters between domains, leading to mutual interference among them. Secondly, due to the distribution differences among domains, the utilization of static parameters in existing methods limits their flexibility to adapt to diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model HAMUR. Specifically, HAMUR consists of two components: (1). Domain-specific adapter, designed as a pluggable module that can be seamlessly integrated into various existing multi-domain backbone models, and (2). Domain-shared hyper-network, which implicitly captures shared information among domains and dynamically generates the parameters for the adapter. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets using various backbone networks. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed model.",

            "abstract": "Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) is a widely used approach for leveraging information from domains with rich data to assist domains with insufficient data. A key challenge of CDR research is the effective and efficient transfer of helpful information from source domain to target domain. Currently, most existing CDR methods focus on extracting implicit information from the source domain to enhance the target domain. However, the hidden structure of the extracted implicit information is highly dependent on the specific CDR model, and is therefore not easily reusable or transferable. Additionally, the extracted implicit information only appears within the intermediate substructure of specific CDRs during training and is thus not easily retained for more use. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes AutoTransfer, with an Instance Transfer Policy Network, to selectively transfers instances from source domain to target domain for improved recommendations. Specifically, AutoTransfer acts as an agent that adaptively selects a subset of informative and transferable instances from the source domain. Notably, the selected subset possesses extraordinary re-utilization property that can be saved for improving model training of various future RS models in target domain. Experimental results on two public CDR benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CDR baselines and classic Single-Domain Recommendation (SDR) approaches. The implementation code is available for easy reproduction.",
