            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Block Adjustment (BA) is a critical procedure in the geometric processing of satellite images, responsible for compensating and correcting the geometric positioning errors of the images. The accuracy of the photogrammetric products, including Digital Orthophoto Map (DOM), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Digital Line Graphic (DLG), and Digital Raster Graphic (DRG), directly depends on the accuracy of BA results. In recent years, the rapid development of related technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Vision (CV), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and big data has greatly facilitated and transformed the classical BA in photogrammetry. This paper first reviews the current status of BA and then looks into the future. First, this paper provides a brief review of the key technologies involved in BA, including image matching, the establishment of adjustment model, the determination of the parameters and the detection of gross error. Then, taking the intercross and fusion of current technologies such as AI, cloud computing and big data with photogrammetry into account, this paper explores the future trends of photogrammetry. Finally, four typical cases of large-scale adjustment are introduced, including large-scale BA without Ground Control Points (GCPs) for optical stereo satellite images, large-scale BA with laser altimetry data for optical stereo satellite images, large-scale BA for UAV oblique photogrammetry, and large-scale BA for indoor photogrammetry in caves with a large number of close-range images.",

            "abstract": "On-orbit geometric calibration (GC) is always performed to compensate for geometric distortion from the satellite\u2019s camera. However, the traditional GC method is complex and difficult to apply broadly due to its reliance on a rigorous physical model (RPM), which involves not only complex processing of attitude, orbit, and time but also the transformation among multiple coordinate systems. In addition, the RPM is closely related to the designs of satellites and cameras, which increases the complexity of the GC and thus reduces generalizability. This article proposes a practical and robust GC method to prevent camera distortion based on a standardized rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) model. Through a series of innovations, including stepwise optimization, a priori gross error elimination, the adjustment model with angular resolution, and the correction for the bias field-of-view (FOV) distortion, we were able to achieve robust GC for camera distortion, as well as accurate splicing and registration among segmented images. Method validation using data from the linear-array camera of the ZiYuan3 (ZY-3)-02 satellite, and the area-array camera of the GaoFen-4 (GF4) satellite, produced satisfactory results, indicating that our method effectively compensates for systematic geometric distortion such that consistent GC and accuracy comparable with that of traditional RPM-based methods can be obtained.",

            "title": "Robust Correction of Relative Geometric Errors Among GaoFen-7 Regional Stereo Images Based on Posteriori Compensation",
            "abstract": "Correcting the relative geometric errors is an essential step in the generation of digital ortho maps and digital surface models from GaoFen-7 (GF-7) regional images, in which the block adjustment (BA) technology is always adopted. However, the traditional BA methods are typically ineffective and not universal due to their dependence on sufficient control data. Although recently developed BA methods using a large number of observation images can substantially eliminate the additional control data, they are not suitable for the BA with few images in the absence of sufficient control data, which is a situation that is often encountered in practical applications. In such situation, the inevitable elevation error caused by the initial positioning error of images will transfer and accumulate in the horizontal direction of the block, resulting in the inconsistent geometric accuracies among images. Aiming at this problem, this article proposed a practical method of combining a stable free BA and a posteriori compensation. Through the stepwise correction and integration of geometric errors, the elevation error and its cumulative effect in free BA could be eliminated at a small control cost, and a robust result with consistent accuracy could be achieved, even with only a few observation images. This method was validated through experiments performed on GF-7 stereo images, and the satisfactory results indicated that it effectively restrained error accumulation and improved the geo-positioning consistency of regional GF-7 images.",

            "title": "AERIAL-TRIANGULATION AIDED BORESIGHT CALIBRATION FOR A LOW-COST UAV-LIDAR SYSTEM",
            "abstract": "Abstract. The Laser-IMU boresight calibration is the precondition for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system (ULS). The existing methods achieve good performance for calibrating ULSs with high-precision positioning and orientation systems (POS) (e.g., APX-15), in which, the systematic errors of the high-precision POS can be ignored, only the boresight parameters are estimated. However, these methods have difficulties in calibrating the low-cost ULSs with low-precision POS. To overcome the impact of the systematic errors of the low-precision POS on boresight calibration, an aerial-triangulation aided boresight calibration is proposed in this paper. It simultaneously estimates the laser-IMU boresight angles and system states (e.g. trajectory) by setting the point clouds derived from aerial-triangulation (AT point clouds) as the reference. Firstly, the planar voxels from the AT point clouds are extracted, due to the fact that they are more reliable in AT point clouds. Secondly, raw laser observations are matched with the extracted planar voxels to establish laser matching observations. Thirdly, a Dynamic Network (DN) is built using the GNSS observations, inertial observations, and laser matching observations to simultaneously optimize the initial laser-IMU boresight angles and the system states. All the sensor observations involved in the ULS are modeled with proper error models, which are essential for analyzing and refining the data quality of the low-cost ULS. The proposed method was tested to calibrate a low-cost ULS, KylinCloud-II, in a calibration field. It showed that the average distance between the laser point clouds and the referenced AT point clouds was decreased from 2.560m (RMSE\u2009=\u20093.88m) to 0.08m (RMSE\u2009=\u20090.99m).",

            "abstract": "Independent methods for geometric calibration (GC) have become an important research direction in the field of optical satellite technology. The main purpose of this research is to eliminate dependence on ground calibration sites using relative constraints between images. Based on a systematic analysis of these relative constraints, we found that it was difficult, if not impossible, to completely eliminate ground constraints, although the number of ground control points (GCPs) required can be greatly reduced. To achieve practical GC with high accuracy and low cost, we proposed a new method to compensate for systematic errors in linear optical satellite data acquisition using only the relative constraints between two overlapped images, namely, the corresponding elevation constraints and sparse GCPs. We first demonstrated the feasibility of GC with relative constraints and established an optimized GC model suitable for these relative constraints. We then presented a global iterative method to eliminate inaccuracies in internal calibration caused by the different distributions of GCPs within two images. The nadir (NAD) linear camera on board the Zi-Yuan 3 (ZY-3) satellite was used to evaluate the feasibility of the presented GC method; the results indicated that the present method effectively compensated for systematic errors. Thus, this article demonstrated the feasibility of GC without calibration sites.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. We propose using the relative orientation model (ROM) of panoramic to register the MMS LiDAR points and panoramic image sequence, which has the wide applicability. The feature points, extracted and matched from panoramic image pairs, are used to solve the relative position and attitude parameters in the ROM, then, combining the absolute position and attitude parameters of the initial panoramic image, the MMS LiDAR points and panoramic image sequence are registered. First, we propose the position/attitude ROM (PA-ROM) and attitude ROM (A-ROM) of panoramic images respectively, which are apply to the position/attitude parameters both unknown and only the attitude parameters unknown. Second, we automatically extract and match feature points from panoramic image pairs using the SURF algorithm, as these mismatching points will affect the registration accuracy, the RANSAC algorithm and ROM were used to choose the best matching points automatically. Finally, we select the feature points manually from MMS LiDAR points and panoramic image sequence as the checkpoints, and then compare the registration accuracy of continuous/discontinuous panoramic image pairs. The results show that MMS LiDAR points and panoramic image sequence are registered accurately based on ROM (7.36 and 3.75 pixels in dataset I and II), what's more, our registration method just tackle the image pairs (uninvolved LiDAR points), so it is suitable for more road scenes.",

            "abstract": "Image dense matching has become one of the widely used means for DSM generation due to its good performance in both accuracy and efficiency. However, for water areas, the most common ground object, accurate disparity estimation is always a challenge to excellent image dense matching methods, as represented by semi-global matching (SGM), due to the poor texture. For this reason, a great deal of manual editing is always inevitable before practical applications. The main reason for this is the lack of uniqueness of matching primitives, with fixed size and shape, used by those methods. In this paper, we propose a novel DSM generation method, namely semi-global and block matching (SGBM), to achieve accurate disparity and height estimation in water areas by adaptive block matching instead of pixel matching. First, the water blocks are extracted by seed point growth, and an adaptive block matching strategy considering geometrical deformations, called end-block matching (EBM), is adopted to achieve accurate disparity estimation. Then, the disparity of all other pixels beyond these water blocks is obtained by SGM. Last, the median value of height of all pixels within the same block is selected as the final height for this block after forward intersection. Experiments are conducted on ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) stereo images, and the results show that DSM generated by our method in water areas has high accuracy and visual quality.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. Mobile laser scanning systems (MLS) have been widely used in collecting three-dimensional point clouds for many applications, such as 3D mapping, road facilities inventory and high definition map. Although MLS is calibrated accurately to obtain precise locations of point clouds, it is still challenging to obtain precise locations of point clouds in the areas of GPS signal denied or narrow streets with high dense buildings, resulting in uneven position deviations of point clouds between the overlapping trajectory areas. In this paper, a marker-free calibration method is proposed to solve the above problems. The proposed method firstly partitions the trajectory into segments according to the error distribution while collecting the point clouds. Secondly, the features in each overlapped area are extracted and a kind of Locally Aggregated Descriptors are built for the matching. Thirdly, a coarse-to-fine pairwise point clouds alignment is applied on the overlapping areas. Finally, the global alignment of point clouds is fulfilled with minimizing the position deviations between the overlapping areas and the adjacent segments. The proposed method has been used to correct the point clouds from several different MLSs. Experiments show that this method automatically locates and corrects the uneven position deviations in terms of good robustness and efficiencies. Besides, it proves that the proposed method is also an easy-to-use tool for the automatic correction of MLS point clouds position and boresights.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. GPRs (Ground Penetrating Radar) are widely adopted in underground space survey and mapping, because of their advantages of fast data acquisition, convenience, high imaging resolution and NDT (Non Destructive Testing) inspection. However, at present, the automation of the GPR data post-processing is low and the identification of underground objects needs expert interpretation. The heavy manual interpretation labor limits the GPR applications in large-scale urban scenarios. According to the latest research, it is still an unsolved problem to detect targets or defects in GPR data automatically and needs further exploration. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method for real-time detection of underground targets from GPR data. Seven typical targets in urban underground space are identified and labelled to construct the training dataset. The constructed dataset is consist of 489 labelled samples including rainwater wells, cables, metal/nonmetal pipes, sparse/dense steel reinforcement, voids. The training dataset is further augmented to produce more samples. DarkNet53 convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained using the constructed training dataset including realistic data and augmented data to extract features of the buried objects. And then the end-to-end YOLO detection framework is used to classify and locate the seven specific categories buried targets in the GPR data in real time. Experiments show that the automatic real-time detection method proposed in this paper can effectively detect the buried objects in the ground penetrating radar image in real time at Shenzhen test site (typical urban road scene).\n",

            "abstract": "Geometric calibration (GC) is a technique to compensate for the systematic errors in the imaging model of an optical satellite. The independent GC method without use of ground calibration site has been studied in recent years. In this paper, an integrated independent method aiming to the GC of stereo cameras aboard an optical satellite is presented. Supported by the satellite's stereo imaging ability, this method can overcome the strong correlation between the elevation error and camera GC accuracy, and get rid of the dependency on the constraints of ground elevation further. The real data collected by the stereo three-linear camera (TLC) of ZY-3 satellite was used to verify this method. The satisfactory GC accuracy better than 1 pixel indicated that the presented method effectively compensated for systematic errors, and improved the geometric quality of TLC images together.",
