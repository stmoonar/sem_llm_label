            "abstract": "The paper advances belief representation learning in polarized networks \u2013 the mapping of social beliefs espoused by users and posts in a polarized network into a disentangled latent space that separates (the members and beliefs of) each side. Our prior work embeds social interaction data, using non-negative variational graph auto-encoders, into a disentangled latent space. However, the interaction graphs alone may not adequately reflect similarity and/or disparity in beliefs, especially for those graphs with sparsity and outlier issues. In this paper, we investigate the impact of limited guidance from Large Language Models (LLMs) on the accuracy of belief separation. Specifically, we integrate social graphs with LLM-based soft labels as a novel weakly-supervised interpretable graph representation learning framework. This framework combines the strengths of graph-and text-based information, and is shown to maintain the interpretability of learned representations, where different axes in the latent space denote association with different sides of the divide. An evaluation on six real-world Twitter datasets illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed model at solving stance detection problems, demonstrating 5.9%-6.5% improvements in the accuracy, F1 score, and purity metrics, without introducing a significant computational overhead. An ablation study is also discussed to study the impact of different components of the proposed architecture.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a generative data augmentation approach for human activity recognition (HAR) to close the distribution gap between laboratory training and real-world deployment. Despite the recent success of deep learning methods in wearable sensor-based HAR tasks, performance degradation occurs during real-world deployment due to training data scarcity and the vast variability in human activities. In light of this, we aim to enhance the diversity of training datasets by generating new data points within the vicinity of existing samples, as informed by domain expertise. Unlike the commonly utilized methods that augment data by interpolating in data space or feature space, we innovate by applying interpolation in the condition space of a conditional generative model to augment HAR datasets. We use domain-specific knowledge to extract statistical metrics from sensor data, which serve as conditions to direct the generation process. We demonstrate how a conditional generative diffusion model, steered by interpolated conditions, can synthesize realistic new data with various high-level features that benefit the robustness of the downstream HAR models. Our methodology advances the use of interpolation in data augmentation by exploring the capability of a state-of-the-art generative model, offering novel perspectives for bolstering the robustness and generalizability of HAR systems. Experimental results demonstrate that condition space interpolation outperforms the conventional interpolation-based and generative model-based augmentation methods across various datasets and downstream classifier combinations.",

            "abstract": "This article derives a new nonlinear stochastic model of the evolution of human beliefs that demonstrates how an increase in democratized information production and sharing, combined with consumers' confirmation bias and natural bias for outlying content, results in increased polarization. The model shows that the evolution of human beliefs can be approximated by a nonlinear diffusion\u2013drift equation, in which systematic psychological biases contribute to drift, whereas other random influences contribute to diffusion. The nonlinear formulation predicts a growth in polarization that is attributable to increasing information production and sharing. While the core contribution is analytical, an anecdotal model parameter fitting empirical data is also presented. Specifically, we show that our model closely predicts the changing and increasingly polarized distribution of ideology of members of the US congress over the last quarter century (taken as an approximate proxy for shifts in the US population ideology), when we take the mobile-phone penetration curve as a proxy for the democratization of information access. The model suggests that escaping the polarizing forces in the age of information access may be an uphill battle.",

            "title": "Influence Pathway Discovery on Social Media",
            "abstract": "This paper addresses influence pathway discovery, a key emerging problem in today's online media. We propose a discovery algorithm that leverages recently published work on unsupervised interpretable ideological embedding, a mapping of ideological beliefs (done in a self-supervised fashion) into interpretable low-dimensional spaces. Computing the ideological embedding at scale allows one to analyze correlations between the ideological positions of leaders, influencers, news portals, or population segments, deriving potential influence pathways. The work is motivated by the importance of social media as the preeminent means for global interactions and collaborations on today's Internet, as well as their frequent (mis-)use to wield influence that targets social beliefs and attitudes of selected populations. Tools that enable the understanding and mapping of influence propagation through population segments on social media are therefore increasingly important. In this paper, influence is measured by the perceived ideological shift over time that is correlated with influencers' activity. Correlated shifts in ideological embed dings indicate changes, such as swings/switching (among competing ideologies), polarization (depletion of neutral ideological positions), escalation/radicalization (shifts to more extreme versions of the ideology), or unification/cooldown (shifts towards more neutral stances). Case-studies are presented to explore selected influence pathways (i) in a recent French election, (ii) during political discussions in the Philippines, and (iii) for some Russian messaging during the Russia/Ukraine conflict.",

State-of-the-art methods fall short in the speculative reasoning ability, as they assume the correctness of a fact is solely determined by its presence in KG, making them vulnerable to false negative/positive issues. The new reasoning task is formulated as a noisy Positive-Unlabeled learning problem. We propose a variational framework, namely nPUGraph, that jointly estimates the correctness of both collected and uncollected facts (which we call \\textit{label posterior}) and updates model parameters during training. The label posterior estimation facilitates speculative reasoning from two perspectives. First, it improves the robustness of a label posterior-aware graph encoder against false positive links. Second, it identifies missing facts to provide high-quality grounds of reasoning. They are unified in a simple yet effective self-training procedure. Empirically, extensive experiments on three benchmark KG and one Twitter dataset with various degrees of false negative/positive cases demonstrate the effectiveness of nPUGraph.",

            "abstract": "The proliferation of political memes in modern information campaigns calls for efficient solutions for image classification by ideological affiliation. While significant advances have recently been made on text classification in modern natural language processing literature, understanding the political insinuation in imagery is less developed due to the hard nature of the problem. Unlike text, where meaning arises from juxtaposition of tokens (words) within some common linguistic structures, image semantics emerge from a much less constrained process of fusion of visual concepts. Thus, training a model to infer visual insinuation is possibly a more challenging problem. In this paper, we explore an alternative unsupervised approach that, instead, infers ideological affiliation from image propagation patterns on social media. The approach is shown to improve the F1-score by over 0.15 (nearly 25%) over previous unsupervised baselines, and then by another 0.05 (around 7%) in the presence of a small amount of supervision.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents AdaMask, a machine-centric video streaming framework for remote deep neural network (DNN) inference. The objective is to optimize the accuracy of downstream DNNs, offloaded to a remote machine, by adaptively changing video compression control knobs at runtime. Our main contributions are twofold. First, we propose frame masking as an effective mechanism to reduce the bandwidth consumption of video stream, which only preserves regions that potentially contain objects of interest. Second, we design a new adaptation algorithm that achieves the Pareto-optimal tradeoff between accuracy and bandwidth by controlling the masked portions of frames together with conventional H.264 control knobs (eg. resolution). Through extensive evaluations on three sensing scenarios (dash camera, traffic surveillance, and drone), frame masking saves the bandwidth by up to 65% with < 1% accuracy degradation, and AdaMask improves the accuracy by up to 14% over the baselines against the network dynamics.",

            "title": "Learning to Sample and Aggregate: Few-shot Reasoning over Temporal Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a realistic but underexplored problem, called few-shot temporal knowledge graph reasoning, that aims to predict future facts for newly emerging entities based on extremely limited observations in evolving graphs. It offers practical value in applications that need to derive instant new knowledge about new entities in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) with minimal supervision. The challenges mainly come from the few-shot and time shift properties of new entities. First, the limited observations associated with them are insufficient for training a model from scratch. Second, the potentially dynamic distributions from the initially observable facts to the future facts ask for explicitly modeling the evolving characteristics of new entities. We correspondingly propose a novel Meta Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (MetaTKGR) framework. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid neighborhood aggregation schemes to enhance low-data entity representation, MetaTKGR dynamically adjusts the strategies of sampling and aggregating neighbors from recent facts for new entities, through temporally supervised signals on future facts as instant feedback. Besides, such a meta temporal reasoning procedure goes beyond existing meta-learning paradigms on static knowledge graphs that fail to handle temporal adaptation with large entity variance. We further provide a theoretical analysis and propose a temporal adaptation regularizer to stabilize the meta temporal reasoning over time. Empirically, extensive experiments on three real-world TKGs demonstrate the superiority of MetaTKGR over state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.",

            "abstract": "The paper describes a methodology for simulating online social media activities that occur in response to external events. A large number of social media simulators model information diffusion on online social networks. However, information cascades do not originate in vacuum. Rather, they often originate as a reaction to events external to the online medium. Thus, to predict activity on the social medium, one must investigate the relation between external stimuli and online social responses. The paper presents a simulation pipeline that features stimulus/response models describing how social systems react to external events of relevance to them. Two case studies are presented to test the fidelity of different models. One investigates online responses to events in the Venezuela election crisis. The other investigates online responses to developments of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). These case studies indicate that simple macroscopic stimulus/response models can accurately predict aggregate online trends.",
