            "title": "Imbalanced Node Classification Beyond Homophilic Assumption",
            "abstract": "Imbalanced node classification widely exists in real-world networks where graph neural networks (GNNs) are usually highly inclined to majority classes and suffer from severe performance degradation on classifying minority class nodes. Various imbalanced node classification methods have been proposed recently which construct synthetic nodes and edges w.r.t. minority classes to balance the label and topology distribution. However, they are all based on the homophilic assumption that nodes of the same label tend to connect despite the wide existence of heterophilic edges in real-world graphs. Thus, they uniformly aggregate features from both homophilic and heterophilic neighbors and rely on feature similarity to generate synthetic edges, which cannot be applied to imbalanced graphs in high heterophily. To address this problem, we propose a novel GraphSANN for imbalanced node classification on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Firstly, we propose a unified feature mixer to generate synthetic nodes with both homophilic and heterophilic interpolation in a unified way. Next, by randomly sampling edges between synthetic nodes and existing nodes as candidate edges, we design an adaptive subgraph extractor to adaptively extract the contextual subgraphs of candidate edges with flexible ranges. Finally, we develop a multi-filter subgraph encoder that constructs different filter channels to discriminatively aggregate neighbor's information along the homophilic and heterophilic edges. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model for imbalanced node classification on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.",

            "title": "BOURNE: Bootstrapped Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Unified Graph Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its critical application in a wide range of domains, such as social networks, financial risk management, and traffic analysis. Existing GAD methods can be categorized into node and edge anomaly detection models based on the type of graph objects being detected. However, these methods typically treat node and edge anomalies as separate tasks, overlooking their associations and frequent co-occurrences in real-world graphs. As a result, they fail to leverage the complementary information provided by node and edge anomalies for mutual detection. Additionally, state-of-the-art GAD methods, such as CoLA and SL-GAD, heavily rely on negative pair sampling in contrastive learning, which incurs high computational costs, hindering their scalability to large graphs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified graph anomaly detection framework based on bootstrapped self-supervised learning (named BOURNE). We extract a subgraph (graph view) centered on each target node as node context and transform it into a dual hypergraph (hypergraph view) as edge context. These views are encoded using graph and hypergraph neural networks to capture the representations of nodes, edges, and their associated contexts. By swapping the context embeddings between nodes and edges and measuring the agreement in the embedding space, we enable the mutual detection of node and edge anomalies. Furthermore, BOURNE can eliminate the need for negative sampling, thereby enhancing its efficiency in handling large graphs. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of BOURNE in detecting both node and edge anomalies.",

            "abstract": "The financing constraint is becoming more and more obvious to the high-quality development of entrepreneurial enterprises, and how to solve this problem has become the focus of theoretical and practical research. Given this, this paper assesses the performance of science and technology finance policy on alleviating the financing constraints of entrepreneurial firms in the pilot regions using a quasi-natural experiment based on the data of GEM listed companies from 2009 to 2020 using the Difference-in-Difference(DID) method. The results show that : (1) The implementation of the policy significantly alleviates the financing constraints of entrepreneurial enterprises. (2) The policy effect of the science and technology finance policy increases significantly from the third year of implementation, indicating that there is a time lag effect of the policy on alleviating the financing constraints of entrepreneurial enterprises. (3) Science and technology finance policy can significantly alleviate the financing constraints of mature entrepreneurial enterprises, but the implementation effect on Startup in the growth stage is not obvious.",

What is lacking in the literature is a comprehensive profile of the discipline. The paper uses bibliometric methods and visualization technologies to conduct a profiling analysis of Web of Science journal articles in the field of intellectual property from the three aspects of authorship network, geographical diffusion of collaboration, and subject cluster. Facilitated by visualization software and programming scripts, the paper presents the highly active scholars in the field through author co-citation analysis (ACA) and document co-citation analysis (DCA), the diffusion networks of collaboration through dynamic geographical graphs, and the five main clusters of disciplinary subjects, namely, Innovation, Judicature, Legislation, Information, and Market.",
