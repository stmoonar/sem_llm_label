            "abstract": "Customers reach out to online live chat agents with various intents, such as asking about product details or requesting a return. In this paper, we propose the problem of predicting user intent from browsing history and address it through a two-stage approach. The first stage classifies a user's browsing history into high-level intent categories. Here, we represent each browsing history as a text sequence of page attributes and use the ground-truth class labels to fine-tune pretrained Transformers. The second stage provides a large language model (LLM) with the browsing history and predicted intent class to generate fine-grained intents. For automatic evaluation, we use a separate LLM to judge the similarity between generated and ground-truth intents, which closely aligns with human judgments. Our two-stage approach yields significant performance gains compared to generating intents without the classification stage.",

We propose the first attempt to optimize the retrieval models that deliver a limited number of personal documents to large language models for the purpose of personalized generation. We develop two optimization algorithms that solicit feedback from the downstream personalized generation tasks for retrieval optimization -- one based on reinforcement learning whose reward function is defined using any arbitrary metric for personalized generation and another based on knowledge distillation from the downstream LLM to the retrieval model. This paper also introduces a pre- and post-generation retriever selection model that decides what retriever to choose for each LLM input. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks from the language model personalization (LaMP) benchmark reveal statistically significant improvements in six out of seven datasets.",

The focus this year was the creation of a reusable collection and evaluation of the impact of the use of metadata and multi-modal data on retrieval accuracy. This year we leverage the new product search corpus, which includes contextual metadata. Our analysis shows that in the product search domain, traditional retrieval systems are highly effective and commonly outperform general-purpose pretrained embedding models. Our analysis also evaluates the impact of using simplified and metadata-enhanced collections, finding no clear trend in the impact of the expanded collection. We also see some surprising outcomes; despite their widespread adoption and competitive performance on other tasks, we find single-stage dense retrieval runs can commonly be noncompetitive or generate low-quality results both in the zero-shot and fine-tuned domain.",

            "abstract": "Developing a universal model that can efficiently and effectively respond to a wide range of information access requests-from retrieval to recommendation to question answering---has been a long-lasting goal in the information retrieval community. This paper argues that the flexibility, efficiency, and effectiveness brought by the recent development in dense retrieval and approximate nearest neighbor search have smoothed the path towards achieving this goal. We develop a generic and extensible dense retrieval framework, called framework, that can handle a wide range of (personalized) information access requests, such as keyword search, query by example, and complementary item recommendation. Our proposed approach extends the capabilities of dense retrieval models for ad-hoc retrieval tasks by incorporating user-specific preferences through the development of a personalized attentive network. This allows for a more tailored and accurate personalized information access experience. Our experiments on real-world e-commerce data suggest the feasibility of developing universal information access models by demonstrating significant improvements even compared to competitive baselines specifically developed for each of these individual information access tasks. This work opens up a number of fundamental research directions for future exploration.",

            "abstract": "Modeling high-level user intent in recommender systems can improve performance, although it is often difficult to obtain a ground truth measure of this intent. In this paper, we investigate a novel way to obtain such an intent signal by leveraging resource pages associated with a particular task. We jointly model product interactions and resource page interactions to create a system which can recommend both products and resource pages to users. Our experiments consider the domain of home improvement product recommendation, where resource pages are DIY (do-it-yourself) project pages from Lowes.com. Each DIY page provides a list of tools, materials, and step-by-step instructions to complete a DIY project, such as building a deck, installing cabinets, and fixing a leaking pipe. We use this data as an indicator of the intended project, which is a natural high-level intent signal for home improvement shoppers. We then extend a state-of-the-art system to incorporate this new intent data, and show a significant improvement in the ability of the system to recommend products. We further demonstrate that our system can be used to successfully recommend DIY project pages to users. We have taken initial steps towards deploying our method for project recommendation in production on the Lowe\u2019s website and for recommendations through marketing emails.",

The purpose of this workshop is (1) to bring together researchers and practitioners of eCommerce IR to discuss topics unique to it, (2) to determine how to use eCommerce's unique combination of free text, structured data, and customer behavior data to improve search relevance, and (3) to examine how to build datasets and evaluate algorithms in this domain. The theme of this year's eCommerce IR workshop is Foundation Models and Unified Information Access in eCommerce. The workshop solicits papers on this topic and includes a panel focused on this area. In addition, Lowe's is sponsoring an eCommerce data challenge on Cross-modal and Multi-modal Visual Search for eCommerce. The data challenge reflects themes from the successful SIGIR workshops in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022.

Despite the simplicity of our approach, our best model was less than 0.004 nDCG@20 below the top submission.

            "title": "eCom'22: The SIGIR 2022 Workshop on eCommerce",
            "abstract": "eCommerce Information Retrieval (IR) is receiving increasing attention in the academic literature and is an essential component of some of the world's largest web sites (e.g. Airbnb, Alibaba, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Flipkart, Lowe's, Taobao, and Target). SIGIR has for several years seen sponsorship from eCommerce organisations, reflecting the importance of IR research to them. The purpose of this workshop is (1) to bring together researchers and practitioners of eCommerce IR to discuss topics unique to it, (2) to determine how to use eCommerce's unique combination of free text, structured data, and customer behavioral data to improve search relevance, and (3) to examine how to build datasets and evaluate algorithms in this domain. Since eCommerce customers often do not know exactly what they want to buy (i.e. navigational and spearfishing queries are rare), recommendations are valuable for inspiration and serendipitous discovery as well as basket building. The theme of this year's eCommerce IR workshop is Bridging IR Metrics and Business Metrics and Multi-objective Optimization. The workshop includes papers on this topic as well as a panel focused on this area (see Section 3). In addition, Farfetch is sponsoring a recommendation challenge focused on outfit completion: as part of the event, Farfetch will release to the research community a novel, large dataset containing multi-modal information and extensive labels curated by fashion experts. The data challenge reflects themes from prior SIGIR workshops in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021.",
