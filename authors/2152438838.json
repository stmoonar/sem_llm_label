            "title": "Leveraging GPT-4 for Food Effect Summarization to Enhance Product-Specific Guidance Development via Iterative Prompting",
            "abstract": "Food effect summarization from New Drug Application (NDA) is an essential component of product-specific guidance (PSG) development and assessment, which provides the basis of recommendations for fasting and fed bioequivalence studies to guide the pharmaceutical industry for developing generic drug products. However, manual summarization of food effect from extensive drug application review documents is time-consuming. Therefore, there is a need to develop automated methods to generate food effect summary. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have demonstrated great potential in improving the effectiveness of automated text summarization, but its ability with regard to the accuracy in summarizing food effect for PSG assessment remains unclear. In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective approach,iterative prompting, which allows one to interact with ChatGPT or GPT-4 more effectively and efficiently through multi-turn interaction. Specifically, we propose a three-turn iterative prompting approach to food effect summarization in which the keyword-focused and length-controlled prompts are respectively provided in consecutive turns to refine the quality of the generated summary. We conduct a series of extensive evaluations, ranging from automated metrics to FDA professionals and even evaluation by GPT-4, on 100 NDA review documents selected over the past five years. We observe that the summary quality is progressively improved throughout the iterative prompting process. Moreover, we find that GPT-4 performs better than ChatGPT, as evaluated by FDA professionals (43% vs. 12%) and GPT-4 (64% vs. 35%). Importantly, all the FDA professionals unanimously rated that 85% of the summaries generated by GPT-4 are factually consistent with the golden reference summary, a finding further supported by GPT-4 rating of 72% consistency. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a great potential for GPT-4 to draft food effect summaries that could be reviewed by FDA professionals, thereby improving the efficiency of the PSG assessment cycle and promoting generic drug product development.",

            "abstract": "Product-specific guidances (PSGs) recommended by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are instrumental to promote and guide generic drug product development. To assess a PSG, the FDA assessor needs to take extensive time and effort to manually retrieve supportive drug information of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) from the reference listed drug labeling. In this work, we leveraged the state-of-the-art pre-trained language models to automatically label the ADME paragraphs in the pharmacokinetics section from the FDA-approved drug labeling to facilitate PSG assessment. We applied a transfer learning approach by fine-tuning the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to develop a novel application of ADME semantic labeling, which can automatically retrieve ADME paragraphs from drug labeling instead of manual work. We demonstrate that fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model can outperform conventional machine learning techniques, achieving up to 12.5% absolute F1 improvement. To our knowledge, we were the first to successfully apply BERT to solve the ADME semantic labeling task. We further assessed the relative contribution of pre-training and fine-tuning to the overall performance of the BERT model in the ADME semantic labeling task using a series of analysis methods, such as attention similarity and layer-based ablations. Our analysis revealed that the information learned via fine-tuning is focused on task-specific knowledge in the top layers of the BERT, whereas the benefit from the pre-trained BERT model is from the bottom layers.",

            "title": "Two-Stage Fine-Tuning: A Novel Strategy for Learning Class-Imbalanced Data",
            "abstract": ": Classification on long-tailed distributed data is a challenging problem, which suffers from serious class-imbalance and hence poor performance on tail classes with only a few samples. Owing to this paucity of samples, learning on the tail classes is especially challenging for the fine-tuning when transferring a pretrained model to a downstream task. In this work, we present a simple modification of standard fine-tuning to cope with these challenges. Specifically, we propose a two-stage fine-tuning: we first fine-tune the final layer of the pretrained model with class-balanced reweighting loss, and then we perform the standard fine-tuning. Our modification has several benefits: (1) it leverages pretrained representations by only fine-tuning a small portion of the model parameters while keeping the rest untouched; (2) it allows the model to learn an initial representation of the specific task; and importantly (3) it protects the learning of tail classes from being at a disadvantage during the model updating. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic datasets of both two-class and multi-class tasks of text classification as well as a real-world application to ADME (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) semantic labeling. The experimental results show that the proposed two-stage fine-tuning outperforms both fine-tuning with conventional loss and fine-tuning with a reweighting loss on the above datasets.",

Such class imbalance poses a major challenge for modern deep learning, even with the typical class-balanced approaches such as re-sampling and re-weighting.
