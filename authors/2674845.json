            "abstract": "We present IMU2CLIP, a novel pre-training approach to align Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) motion sensor recordings with video and text, by projecting them into the joint representation space of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). The proposed approach allows IMU2CLIP to translate human motions (as measured by IMU sensors) into their corresponding textual descriptions and videos -- while preserving the transitivity across these modalities. We explore several new IMU-based applications that IMU2CLIP enables, such as motion-based media retrieval and natural language reasoning tasks with motion data. In addition, we show that IMU2CLIP can significantly improve the downstream performance when fine-tuned for each application (e.g. activity recognition), demonstrating the universal usage of IMU2CLIP as a new pre-trained resource. Our code will be made publicly available.",

We study a probabilistic motion model fitted to the trajectories of biobots, perturbed from their natural motion by the stimulation pulses. Furthermore, we provide a statistical assessment of the biobotic directional response to turn commands and its correlation with stimuli profile over time.

We consider agents mimicking motion behaviors of cyborg insects, known as biobots, and exploit coordinate-free local interactions among them to infer geometric and topological information about the environment, under minimal sensing and localization constraints. A metric estimation procedure is presented over a graphical representation referred to as the encounter graph in order to construct a geometric point cloud using manifold learning techniques. Topological data analysis (TDA) along with the proposed classification method is used to infer robust topological features of the space (e.g., existence of obstacles). We examine the asymptotic behavior of the proposed metric in terms of the convergence to the geodesic distances in the underlying manifold of the domain, and provide stability analysis results for the topological persistence. The proposed framework and its convergences and stability analysis are demonstrated through numerical simulations and experiments with Hexbugs.",

The proposed robust mapping technique constructs a topological map of the environment using only encounter information from the swarm. A sliding window strategy is adopted in conjunction with a topological mapping strategy based on local interactions among the swarm in a coordinate-free fashion to obtain local maps of the environment. These maps are then merged into a global topological map which can be visualized using a graphical representation that integrates geometric as well as topological feature of the environment. Localized robust topological features are extracted using tools from topological data analysis. Simulation results have been presented to illustrate and verify the correctness of our dynamic mapping algorithm.",

These agents can be used in applications such as mapping and exploration of environment for emergency response (e.g., search and rescue operations after earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, etc.) These agents can gain access to locations that may not be reachable otherwise by moving underground through smaller locations. The power limitations of such platforms place restrictions on sensing, communication, and motion control. Hence, traditional mapping and exploration techniques may not perform well under these adverse conditions. We propose a robust approach to obtain a topological map of an unknown environment using the coordinate free sensory data obtained from these cyborg-insect networks. In order to minimize control input, we take advantage of the natural behavior of insects in order to estimate a topological model of the environment based only on neighbor-to-neighbor interactions.",

A probabilistic motion model of mobile sensing nodes, inspired by motion characteristics of cockroaches, is utilized to extract weak encounter information in order to build a topological representation of the environment. \nNeighbor to neighbor interactions among the nodes are exploited to build point clouds representing spatial features of the manifold characterizing the environment based on the sampled data. \nTo extract dominant features from sampled data, topological data analysis is used to produce persistence intervals for features, to be used for topological mapping. In order to improve robustness characteristics of the sampled data with respect to outliers, density based subsampling algorithms are employed. Moreover, a robust scale-invariant classification algorithm for persistence diagrams is proposed to provide a quantitative representation of desired features in the data.

            "abstract": "The potential benefits of distributed robotics systems in applications requiring situational awareness, such as search-and-rescue in emergency situations, are indisputable. The efficiency of such systems requires robotic agents capable of coping with uncertain and dynamic environmental conditions. For example, after an earthquake, a tremendous effort is spent for days to reach to surviving victims where robotic swarms or other distributed robotic systems might play a great role in achieving this faster. However, current technology falls short of offering centimeter scale mobile agents that can function effectively under such conditions. Insects, the inspiration of many robotic swarms, exhibit an unmatched ability to navigate through such environments while successfully maintaining control and stability. We have benefitted from recent developments in neural engineering and neuromuscular stimulation research to fuse the locomotory advantages of insects with the latest developments in wireless networking technologies to enable biobotic insect agents to function as search-and-rescue agents. Our research efforts towards this goal include development of biobot electronic backpack technologies, establishment of biobot tracking testbeds to evaluate locomotion control efficiency, investigation of biobotic control strategies with Gromphadorhina portentosa cockroaches and Manduca sexta moths, establishment of a localization and communication infrastructure, modeling and controlling collective motion by learning deterministic and stochastic motion models, topological motion modeling based on these models, and the development of a swarm robotic platform to be used as a testbed for our algorithms.",

Under extreme conditions, traditional localization techniques may fail to provide reliable position estimates.

A classification approach is introduced to determine the persistent topology features of the space. The approach is analyzed using simulation and experimental data using a swarm robotic platform called the WolfBot. For all experiments, the agents are programmed to follow a stochastic motion model and only rely on encounter information between agents to construct a map of the environment. The results indicate that the proposed approach can identify robust topological features with high accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Mapping and exploration are essential tasks for swarm robotic systems. These tasks become extremely challenging when localization information is not available. In this paper, we explore how stochastic motion models and weak encounter information can be exploited to learn topological information about an unknown environment. Our system behavior mimics a probabilistic motion model of cockroaches, as it is inspired by current biobotic (cyborg insect) systems. We employ tools from algebraic topology to extract spatial information of the environment based on neighbor to neighbor interactions among the biologically inspired agents with no need for localization data. This information is used to build a map of persistent topological features of the environment. We analyze the performance of our estimation and propose a switching control mechanism for the motion models to extract features of complex environments in an effective way.",
