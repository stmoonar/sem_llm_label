            "title": "Debiased Contrastive Learning for Time-Series Representation Learning and Fault Detection",
            "abstract": "Building reliable fault detection systems through deep neural networks is an appealing topic in industrial scenarios. In these contexts, the representations extracted by neural networks on available labeled time-series data can reflect system states. However, this endeavor remains challenging due to the necessity of labeled data. Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) is one of the effective approaches to deal with this challenge, but existing SSCL-based models suffer from sampling bias and representation bias problems. This article introduces a debiased contrastive learning framework for time-series data and applies it to industrial fault detection tasks. This framework first develops the multigranularity augmented view generation method to generate augmented views at different granularities. It then introduces the momentum clustering contrastive learning strategy and the expert knowledge guidance mechanism to mitigate sampling bias and representation bias, respectively. Finally, the experiments on a public bearing fault detection dataset and a widely used valve stiction detection dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed feature learning framework.",

            "title": "DCS: Debiased Contrastive Learning with Weak Supervision for Time Series Classification",
            "abstract": "Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has performed excellently on time series classification tasks. Most SSCL- based classification algorithms generate positive and negative samples in the time or frequency domains, focusing on mining similarities between them. However, two issues are not well addressed in the SSCL framework: the sampling bias and the task-agnostic representation problems. Sampling bias indicates fake negative sample selection in SSCL, and task- agnostic representation results in the unknown correlation between the extracted feature and downstream tasks. To address the issues, we propose Debiased Contrastive learning with weak Supervision framework, abbreviated as DCS. It employs the clustering operation to remove fake negative samples and introduces weak supervisory signals into the SSCL framework to guide feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a channel augmentation method that allows the DCS to extract features from local and global perspectives simultaneously. The comprehensive experiments on the widely used datasets show that DCS achieves performance superior to state-of-the-art methods on the widely used popular benchmark datasets.",

            "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) shows impressive performance in many tasks lacking sufficient labels. In this paper, we study SSL in time series anomaly detection (TSAD) by incorporating the characteristics of time series data. Specifically, we build an anomaly detection algorithm consisting of global pattern learning and local association learning. The global pattern learning module builds encoder and decoder to reconstruct the raw time series data to detect global anomalies. To complement the limitation of the global pattern learning that ignores local associations between anomaly points and their adjacent windows, we design a local association learning module, which leverages contrastive predictive coding (CPC) to transform the identification of anomaly points into positive pairs identification. Motivated by the observation that adjusting the distance between the history window and the time point to be detected directly impacts the detection performance in the CPC framework, we further propose a skip-step CPC scheme in the local association learning module which adjusts the distance for better construction of the positive pairs and detection results. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance on SMD and PSM datasets in comparison with 12 state-of-the-art algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved impressive performance on various time series tasks. The most prominent advantage of SSL is that it reduces the dependence on labeled data. Based on the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, even a small amount of labeled data can achieve high performance. Compared with many published self-supervised surveys on computer vision and natural language processing, a comprehensive survey for time series SSL is still missing. To fill this gap, we review current state-of-the-art SSL methods for time series data in this article. To this end, we first comprehensively review existing surveys related to SSL and time series, and then provide a new taxonomy of existing time series SSL methods by summarizing them from three perspectives: generative-based, contrastive-based, and adversarial-based. These methods are further divided into ten subcategories with detailed reviews and discussions about their key intuitions, main frameworks, advantages and disadvantages. To facilitate the experiments and validation of time series SSL methods, we also summarize datasets commonly used in time series forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and clustering tasks. Finally, we present the future directions of SSL for time series analysis.",

            "abstract": "This article proposes a valve stiction detection strategy based on a convolutional neural network. Considering the commonly existing characteristics of industrial time-series signals, the strategy is developed to learn features on multiple timescales automatically. Unlike the traditional approaches using hand-crafted features, the proposed strategy can automatically learn representative features on the time-series data collected from industrial control loops. The strategy is composed of two complementary data conversion methods, a mixed feature learning stage and a fusion decision stage, and it has the following merits: 1) the interaction of different pairs of time series can be effectively captured; and 2) the whole process of feature learning is automatic, and no manual feature extraction is needed. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is evaluated through the comprehensive data, including the International Stiction Data Base, and the real data collected from the real hardware experimental system and the industrial environment. Compared with four traditional methods and three deep-learning-based methods, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms the other methods. Besides performance evaluation, we give the implementation procedure of practical application of the proposed strategy and provide the detailed analysis from the perspective of the data conversion methods and the number of timescales.",
