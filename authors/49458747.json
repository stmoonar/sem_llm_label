            "abstract": "This article discusses a survey carried out within the NexusLinguarum COST Action which aimed to give an overview of existing guidelines (GLs) and best practices (BPs) in linguistic linked data. In particular it focused on four core tasks in the production/publication of linked data: generation, interlinking, publication, and validation. We discuss the importance of GLs and BPs for LLD before describing the survey and its results in full. Finally we offer a number of directions for future work in order to address the findings of the survey.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, we have witnessed a steady growth of linguistic information represented and exposed as linked data on the Web. Such linguistic linked data have stimulated the development and use of openly available linguistic knowledge graphs, as is the case with the Apertium RDF, a collection of interconnected bilingual dictionaries represented and accessible through Semantic Web standards. In this work, we explore techniques that exploit the graph nature of bilingual dictionaries to automatically infer new links (translations). We build upon a cycle density based method: partitioning the graph into biconnected components for a speed-up, and simplifying the pipeline through a careful structural analysis that reduces hyperparameter tuning requirements. We also analyse the shortcomings of traditional evaluation metrics used for translation inference and propose to complement them with new ones, both-word precision (BWP) and both-word recall (BWR), aimed at being more informative of algorithmic improvements. Over twenty-seven language pairs, our algorithm produces dictionaries about 70% the size of existing Apertium RDF dictionaries at a high BWP of 85% from scratch within a minute. Human evaluation shows that 78% of the additional translations generated for dictionary enrichment are correct as well. We further describe an interesting use-case: inferring synonyms within a single language, on which our initial human-based evaluation shows an average accuracy of 84%. We release our tool as free/open-source software which can not only be applied to RDF data and Apertium dictionaries, but is also easily usable for other formats and communities.",

Our approach is based on an OWL ontology that defines a hierarchy of data properties encoding different types of uncertainty. We also illustrate the usefulness of Fuzzy Lemon by showing that it can be used to represent the confidence degrees of automatically discovered translations between pairs of bilingual dictionaries from the Apertium family.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the user's intention is crucial in human-machine interaction. When dealing with text input, Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) techniques play an important role. WSD techniques typically require well-formed sentences as context to operate, and predefined catalogues of word senses. However, such conditions do not always apply, such as when there is a need to disambiguate keywords from a query, or sets of tags describing any Web resource. In this paper, we propose a keyword disambiguation method based on the semantic relatedness between words and ontological terms. Taking advantage of the semantic information captured by word embeddings, our approach maps a set of input keywords to their meanings within a given target ontology. We focus on situations where the available linguistic information is very scarce, hampering natural language based approaches. Experimental results show the feasibility of our approach without previous training for target domains.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the meaning of words is crucial for many tasks that involve human-machine interaction. This has been tackled by research in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. Recently, WSD and many other NLP tasks have taken advantage of embeddings-based representation of words, sentences, and documents. However, when it comes to WSD, most embeddings models suffer from ambiguity as they do not capture the different possible meanings of the words. Even when they do, the list of possible meanings for a word (sense inventory) has to be known in advance at training time to be included in the embeddings space. Unfortunately, there are situations in which such a sense inventory is not known in advance (e.g., an ontology selected at run-time), or it evolves with time and its status diverges from the one at training time. This hampers the use of embeddings models for WSD. Furthermore, traditional WSD techniques do not perform well in situations in which the available linguistic information is very scarce, such as the case of keyword-based queries. In this paper, we propose an approach to keyword disambiguation which grounds on a semantic relatedness between words and senses provided by an external inventory (ontology) that is not known at training time. Building on previous works, we present a semantic relatedness measure that uses word embeddings, and explore different disambiguation algorithms to also exploit both word and sentence representations. Experimental results show that this approach achieves results comparable with the state of the art when applied for WSD, without training for a particular domain.",

            "abstract": "The objective of the Translation Inference Across Dictionar- ies (TIAD) shared task is to explore and compare methods and tech- niques that infer translations indirectly between language pairs, based on other bilingual/multilingual lexicographic resources. In its second, 2019, edition the participating systems were asked to generate new transla- tions automatically among three languages - English, French, Portuguese - based on known indirect translations contained in the Apertium RDF graph. The evaluation of the results was carried out by the organisers against manually compiled language pairs of K Dictionaries. This paper gives an overall description of the shard task, the evaluation data and methodology, and the systems\u2019 results.",
