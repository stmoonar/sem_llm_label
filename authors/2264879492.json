            "abstract": "For analysing real-world networks, graph representation learning is a popular tool. These methods, such as a graph autoencoder (GAE), typically rely on low-dimensional representations, also called embeddings, which are obtained through minimising a loss function; these embeddings are used with a decoder for downstream tasks such as node classification and edge prediction. While GAEs tend to be fairly accurate, they suffer from scalability issues. For improved speed, a Local2Global approach, which combines graph patch embeddings based on eigenvector synchronisation, was shown to be fast and achieve good accuracy. Here we propose L2G2G, a Local2Global method which improves GAE accuracy without sacrificing scalability. This improvement is achieved by dynamically synchronising the latent node representations, while training the GAEs. It also benefits from the decoder computing an only local patch loss. Hence, aligning the local embeddings in each epoch utilises more information from the graph than a single post-training alignment does, while maintaining scalability. We illustrate on synthetic benchmarks, as well as real-world examples, that L2G2G achieves higher accuracy than the standard Local2Global approach and scales efficiently on the larger data sets. We find that for large and dense networks, it even outperforms the slow, but assumed more accurate, GAEs.",

            "abstract": "Conformal prediction is a non-parametric technique for constructing prediction intervals or sets from arbitrary predictive models under the assumption that the data is exchangeable. It is popular as it comes with theoretical guarantees on the marginal coverage of the prediction sets and the split conformal prediction variant has a very low computational cost compared to model training. We study the robustness of split conformal prediction in a data contamination setting, where we assume a small fraction of the calibration scores are drawn from a different distribution than the bulk. We quantify the impact of the corrupted data on the coverage and efficiency of the constructed sets when evaluated on\"clean\"test points, and verify our results with numerical experiments. Moreover, we propose an adjustment in the classification setting which we call Contamination Robust Conformal Prediction, and verify the efficacy of our approach using both synthetic and real datasets.",

            "abstract": "The angular synchronization problem aims to accurately estimate (up to a constant additive phase) a set of unknown angles $\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_n\\in[0, 2\\pi)$ from $m$ noisy measurements of their offsets $\\theta_i-\\theta_j \\;\\mbox{mod} \\; 2\\pi.$ Applications include, for example, sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. An extension of the problem to the heterogeneous setting (dubbed $k$-synchronization) is to estimate $k$ groups of angles simultaneously, given noisy observations (with unknown group assignment) from each group. Existing methods for angular synchronization usually perform poorly in high-noise regimes, which are common in applications. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for the angular synchronization problem, and its heterogeneous extension, by proposing GNNSync, a theoretically-grounded end-to-end trainable framework using directed graph neural networks. In addition, new loss functions are devised to encode synchronization objectives. Experimental results on extensive data sets demonstrate that GNNSync attains competitive, and often superior, performance against a comprehensive set of baselines for the angular synchronization problem and its extension, validating the robustness of GNNSync even at high noise levels.",

            "abstract": "Over recent years, denoising diffusion generative models have come to be considered as state-of-the-art methods for synthetic data generation, especially in the case of generating images. These approaches have also proved successful in other applications such as tabular and graph data generation. However, due to computational complexity, to this date, the application of these techniques to graph data has been restricted to small graphs, such as those used in molecular modeling. In this paper, we propose SaGess, a discrete denoising diffusion approach, which is able to generate large real-world networks by augmenting a diffusion model (DiGress) with a generalized divide-and-conquer framework. The algorithm is capable of generating larger graphs by sampling a covering of subgraphs of the initial graph in order to train DiGress. SaGess then constructs a synthetic graph using the subgraphs that have been generated by DiGress. We evaluate the quality of the synthetic data sets against several competitor methods by comparing graph statistics between the original and synthetic samples, as well as evaluating the utility of the synthetic data set produced by using it to train a task-driven model, namely link prediction. In our experiments, SaGess, outperforms most of the one-shot state-of-the-art graph generating methods by a significant factor, both on the graph metrics and on the link prediction task.",

            "abstract": "\n In economic and financial applications, there is often the need for analysing multivariate time series, comprising of time series for a range of quantities. In some applications, such complex systems can be associated with some underlying network describing pairwise relationships among the quantities. Accounting for the underlying network structure for the analysis of this type of multivariate time series is required for assessing estimation error and can be particularly informative for forecasting. Our work is motivated by a dataset consisting of time series of industry-to-industry transactions. In this example, pairwise relationships between Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes can be represented using a network, with SIC codes as nodes and pairwise transactions between SIC codes as edges, while the observed time series of the amounts of the transactions for each pair of SIC codes can be regarded as time-varying weights on the edges. Inspired by Knight et al. (2020, J. Stat. Softw., 96, 1\u201336), we introduce the GNAR-edge model which allows modelling of multiple time series utilizing the network structure, assuming that each edge weight depends not only on its past values, but also on past values of its neighbouring edges, for a range of neighbourhood stages. The method is validated through simulations. Results from the implementation of the GNAR-edge model on the real industry-to-industry data show good fitting and predictive performance of the model. The predictive performance is improved when sparsifying the network using a lead\u2013lag analysis and thresholding edges according to a lead\u2013lag score.",

We then use this matrix to construct a novel efficient spectral GNN architecture and conduct extensive experiments on both node clustering and link prediction tasks. In these experiments, we consider tasks related to signed information, tasks related to directional information, and tasks related to both signed and directional information. We demonstrate that our proposed spectral GNN is effective for incorporating both signed and directional information, and attains leading performance on a wide range of data sets. Additionally, we provide a novel synthetic network model, which we refer to as the Signed Directed Stochastic Block Model, and a number of novel real-world data sets based on lead-lag relationships in financial time series.",

            "abstract": "Generative models for network time series (also known as dynamic graphs) have tremendous potential in fields such as epidemiology, biology and economics, where complex graph-based dynamics are core objects of study. Designing flexible and scalable generative models is a very challenging task due to the high dimensionality of the data, as well as the need to represent temporal dependencies and marginal network structure. Here we introduce DAMNETS, a scalable deep generative model for network time series. DAMNETS outperforms competing methods on all of our measures of sample quality, over both real and synthetic data sets.",
