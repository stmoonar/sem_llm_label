            "title": "ReLLa: Retrieval-enhanced Large Language Models for Lifelong Sequential Behavior Comprehension in Recommendation",
            "abstract": "With large language models (LLMs) achieving remarkable breakthroughs in NLP domains, LLM-enhanced recommender systems have received much attention and have been actively explored currently. In this paper, we focus on adapting and empowering a pure large language model for zero-shot and few-shot recommendation tasks. First and foremost, we identify and formulate the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem for LLMs in recommendation domains, i.e., LLMs fail to extract useful information from a textual context of long user behavior sequence, even if the length of context is far from reaching the context limitation of LLMs. To address such an issue and improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, namely Retrieval enhanced Large Language models (ReLLa) for recommendation tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. For zero-shot recommendation, we perform semantic user behavior retrieval (SUBR) to improve the data quality of testing samples, which greatly reduces the difficulty for LLMs to extract the essential knowledge from user behavior sequences. As for few-shot recommendation, we further design retrieval-enhanced instruction tuning (ReiT) by adopting SUBR as a data augmentation technique for training samples. Specifically, we develop a mixed training dataset consisting of both the original data samples and their retrieval-enhanced counterparts. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of ReLLa compared with existing baseline models, as well as its capability for lifelong sequential behavior comprehension. To be highlighted, with only less than 10% training samples, few-shot ReLLa can outperform traditional CTR models that are trained on the entire training set (e.g., DCNv2, DIN, SIM).",

            "abstract": "The information on the Internet is increasingly complicated, users can not use the search engine to accurately find effective information. But the emergence of the recommendation system can effectively alleviate this problem. Algorithms such as collaborative filtering have a large drop in recommended quality when user ratings are sparse.\u00a0 We propose a novel cross attentive collaborative filtering model. Our model can learn more about the potential relationships between users, items and ratings. To validate the validity of the algorithm model, experiments were performed on public datasets. The experimental results show that the mae and rmse index have decreased.",

            "abstract": "With the development of economy, tourism is favored by more and more people, and location-based point-of-interest recommendation (POI) begins to emerge. This paper proposes the lstm-based recommendation algorithm for cross-attention mechanism (L-Attention). Embedding method was used to accurately learn the location sequence and location information of users, and feature information of location data was extracted through LSTM network. At the same time, the cross-attention mechanism is introduced to conduct dynamic modeling of personalized time check-in sequence, which can integrate the user's behavioral preference, location sequence information and the influence of sequential location on next-poi, so as to improve the accuracy of recommendation. This article uses Foursquare as an experimental data set. The results show that compared with the traditional recommendation algorithm which only considers the popularity of POI and the deep learning recommendation algorithm which only considers the timing, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is greatly improved.",

            "title": "General Collaborative Filtering for Web Service QoS Prediction",
            "abstract": "To avoid the expensive and time-consuming evaluation, collaborative filtering (CF) methods have been widely studied for web service QoS prediction in recent years. Among the various CF techniques, matrix factorization is the most popular one. Much effort has been devoted to improving matrix factorization collaborative filtering. The key idea of matrix factorization is that it assumes the rating matrix is low rank and projects users and services into a shared low-dimensional latent space, making a prediction by using the dot product of a user latent vector and a service latent vector. Unfortunately, unlike the recommender systems, QoS usually takes continuous values with very wide range, and the low rank assumption might incur high bias. Furthermore, when the QoS matrix is extremely sparse, the low rank assumption also incurs high variance. To reduce the bias, we must use more complex assumptions. To reduce the variance, we can adopt complex regularization techniques. In this paper, we proposed a neural network based framework, named GCF (general collaborative filtering), with the dropout regularization, to model the user-service interactions. We conduct our experiments on a large real-world dataset, the QoS values of which are obtained from 339 users on 5825 web services. The comprehensive experimental studies show that our approach offers higher prediction accuracy than the traditional collaborative filtering approaches.",
