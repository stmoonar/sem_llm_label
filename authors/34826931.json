            "abstract": "In a hyper-relational knowledge graph, a triplet can be associated with a set of qualifiers, where a qualifier is composed of a relation and an entity, providing auxiliary information for the triplet. While existing hyper-relational knowledge graph embedding methods assume that the entities are discrete objects, some information should be represented using numeric values, e.g., (J.R.R., was born in, 1892). Also, a triplet (J.R.R., educated at, Oxford Univ.) can be associated with a qualifier such as (start time, 1911). In this paper, we propose a unified framework named HyNT that learns representations of a hyper-relational knowledge graph containing numeric literals in either triplets or qualifiers. We define a context transformer and a prediction transformer to learn the representations based not only on the correlations between a triplet and its qualifiers but also on the numeric information. By learning compact representations of triplets and qualifiers and feeding them into the transformers, we reduce the computation cost of using transformers. Using HyNT, we can predict missing numeric values in addition to missing entities or relations in a hyper-relational knowledge graph. Experimental results show that HyNT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.",

            "abstract": "Inductive knowledge graph completion has been considered as the task of predicting missing triplets between new entities that are not observed during training. While most inductive knowledge graph completion methods assume that all entities can be new, they do not allow new relations to appear at inference time. This restriction prohibits the existing methods from appropriately handling real-world knowledge graphs where new entities accompany new relations. In this paper, we propose an INductive knowledge GRAph eMbedding method, InGram, that can generate embeddings of new relations as well as new entities at inference time. Given a knowledge graph, we define a relation graph as a weighted graph consisting of relations and the affinity weights between them. Based on the relation graph and the original knowledge graph, InGram learns how to aggregate neighboring embeddings to generate relation and entity embeddings using an attention mechanism. Experimental results show that InGram outperforms 14 different state-of-the-art methods on varied inductive learning scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Most existing retrieval-augmented language models (LMs) assume a naive dichotomy within a retrieved document set: query-relevance and irrelevance. Our work investigates a more challenging scenario in which even the\"relevant\"documents may contain misleading or incorrect information, causing conflict among the retrieved documents and thereby negatively influencing model decisions as noise. We observe that existing LMs are highly brittle to the presence of conflicting information in both the fine-tuning and in-context few-shot learning scenarios. We propose approaches for handling knowledge conflicts among retrieved documents by explicitly fine-tuning a discriminator or prompting GPT-3.5 to elicit its discriminative capability. Our empirical results on open-domain QA show that these approaches significantly enhance model robustness. We also provide our findings on incorporating the fine-tuned discriminator's decision into the in-context learning process, proposing a way to exploit the benefits of two disparate learning schemes. Alongside our findings, we provide MacNoise, a machine-generated, conflict-induced dataset to further encourage research in this direction.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs represent known facts using triplets. While existing knowledge graph embedding methods only consider the connections between entities, we propose considering the relationships between triplets. For example, let us consider two triplets T1 and T2 where T1 is (Academy_Awards, Nominates, Avatar) and T2 is (Avatar, Wins, Academy_Awards). Given these two base-level triplets, we see that T1 is a prerequisite for T2. In this paper, we define a higher-level triplet to represent a relationship between triplets, e.g., where PrerequisiteFor is a higher-level relation. We define a bi-level knowledge graph that consists of the base-level and the higher-level triplets. We also propose a data augmentation strategy based on the random walks on the bi-level knowledge graph to augment plausible triplets. Our model called BiVE learns embeddings by taking into account the structures of the base-level and the higher-level triplets, with additional consideration of the augmented triplets. We propose two new tasks: triplet prediction and conditional link prediction. Given a triplet T1 and a higher-level relation, the triplet prediction predicts a triplet that is likely to be connected to T1 by the higher-level relation, e.g., . The conditional link prediction predicts a missing entity in a triplet conditioned on another triplet, e.g., . Experimental results show that BiVE significantly outperforms all other methods in the two new tasks and the typical base-level link prediction in real-world bi-level knowledge graphs.",

            "abstract": "A code property graph (CPG) is a joint representation of syntax, control flows, and data flows of a target application. Recent studies have demonstrated the promising efficacy of leveraging CPGs for the identification of vulnerabilities. It recasts the problem of implementing a specific static analysis for a target vulnerability as a graph query composition problem. It requires devising coarse-grained graph queries that model vulnerable code patterns. Unfortunately, such coarse-grained queries often leave vulnerabilities due to faulty input sanitization undetected. In this paper, we propose, a scalable system designed to identify various web vulnerabilities, including bugs that stem from incorrect sanitization. We designed to find a subgraph in a target CPG that matches a given CPG query having a known vulnerability, which is known as the subgraph isomorphism problem. To address the scalability challenge that stems from the NP-complete nature of this problem, leverages optimization techniques designed to boost the efficiency of matching vulnerable subgraphs. found confirmed vulnerabilities including CVEs among 2,464 potential vulnerabilities in real-world CPGs having a combined total of 1 billion nodes and 1.2 billion edges.",

            "abstract": "Semantic grasping aims to make stable robotic grasps suitable for specific object manipulation tasks. While existing semantic grasping models focus only on the grasping regions of objects based on their affordances, reasoning about which gripper to use for grasping, e.g., a rigid parallel-jaw gripper or a soft gripper, and how strongly to grasp the target object allows more sophisticated robotic manipulation. In this letter, we create a knowledge graph of robotic manipulation named roboKG to represent information about objects (e.g., the material and the components of an object), tasks, and appropriate robotic manipulation such as which component of an object to grasp, which gripper to use, and how strongly to grasp. Using knowledge graph embedding, we generate semantic representations of the entities and relations in roboKG, enabling us to make predictions on robotic manipulation. Based on the predicted gripper type, grasping component, and grasping force, a real robot performs seven different real-world tasks on 42 household objects, achieving an accuracy of 95.21%.",

            "abstract": "Automated debugging techniques, such as Fault Localisation (FL) or Automated Program Repair (APR), are typically designed under the Single Fault Assumption (SFA). However, in practice, an unknown number of faults can independently cause multiple test case failures, making it difficult to allocate resources for debugging and to use automated debugging techniques. Clustering algorithms have been applied to group the test failures according to their root causes, but their accuracy can often be lacking due to the inherent limits in the distance metrics for test cases. We introduce a new test distance metric based on hypergraphs and evaluate their accuracy using multi-fault benchmarks that we have built on top of Defects4J and SIR. Results show that our technique, Hybiscus, can automatically achieve perfect clustering (i.e., the same number of clusters as the ground truth number of root causes, with all failing tests with the same root cause grouped together) for 418 out of 605 test runs with multiple test failures. Better failure clustering also allows us to separate different root causes and apply FL techniques under SFA, resulting in saving up to 82% of the total wasted effort when compared to the state-of-the-art technique for multiple fault localisation.",

Without any prior information about entity types, a set of semantically close entities is successfully merged into one super-entity in our metagraph representation.

It collects, records, and archives a large amount of unstructured data; therefore, techniques are required to organize and summarize those data for easy retrieval. Lifelogging has been utilized for diverse applications including healthcare, self-tracking, and entertainment, among others. With regard to the image-based lifelogging, even though most users prefer to present photos with facial expressions that allow us to infer their emotions, there have been few studies on lifelogging techniques that focus upon users\u2019 emotions. In this paper, we develop a system that extracts users\u2019 own photos from their smartphones and configures their lifelogs with a focus on their emotions. We design an emotion classifier based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict the users\u2019 emotions. To train the model, we create a new dataset by collecting facial images from the CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) dataset and labeling their facial emotion expressions, and by integrating parts of the Radboud Faces Database (RaFD). Our dataset consists of 4,715 high-resolution images. We propose Representative Emotional Data Extraction Scheme (REDES) to select representative photos based on inferring users\u2019 emotions from their facial expressions. In addition, we develop a system that allows users to easily configure diaries for a special day and summaize their lifelogs. Our experimental results show that our method is able to effectively incorporate emotions into lifelog, allowing an enriched experience.",

Hypergraphs model real-world data by allowing a hyperedge to include two or more entities. Clustering of hypergraphs enables us to group the similar entities together. While most existing algorithms solely consider the connection structure of a hypergraph to solve the clustering problem, we can boost the clustering performance by considering various features associated with the entities as well as auxiliary relationships among the entities. Also, we can further improve the clustering performance if some of the labels are known and we incorporate them into a clustering model. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised clustering framework for hypergraphs that is able to easily incorporate not only multiple relationships among the entities but also multiple attributes and content of the entities from diverse sources. Furthermore, by showing the close relationship between the hypergraph normalized cut and the weighted kernel K-Means, we also develop an efficient multilevel hypergraph clustering method which provides a good initialization with our semi-supervised multi-view clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm is effective in detecting the ground-truth clusters and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",
