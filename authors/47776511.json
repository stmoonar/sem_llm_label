            "abstract": "Existing Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) predominantly utilize user simulators for training and evaluating recommendation policies. These simulators often oversimplify the complexity of user interactions by focusing solely on static item attributes, neglecting the rich, evolving preferences that characterize real-world user behavior. This limitation frequently leads to models that perform well in simulated environments but falter in actual deployment. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Tri-Phase Offline Policy Learning-based Conversational Recommender System (TCRS), which significantly reduces dependency on real-time interactions and mitigates overfitting issues prevalent in traditional approaches. TCRS integrates a model-based offline learning strategy with a controllable user simulation that dynamically aligns with both personalized and evolving user preferences. Through comprehensive experiments, TCRS demonstrates enhanced robustness, adaptability, and accuracy in recommendations, outperforming traditional CRS models in diverse user scenarios. This approach not only provides a more realistic evaluation environment but also facilitates a deeper understanding of user behavior dynamics, thereby refining the recommendation process.",

            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) commonly assume users have clear preferences, leading to potential over-filtering of relevant alternatives. However, users often exhibit vague, non-binary preferences. We introduce the Vague Preference Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (VPMCR) scenario, employing a soft estimation mechanism to accommodate users' vague and dynamic preferences while mitigating over-filtering. In VPMCR, we propose Vague Preference Policy Learning (VPPL), consisting of Ambiguity-aware Soft Estimation (ASE) and Dynamism-aware Policy Learning (DPL). ASE captures preference vagueness by estimating scores for clicked and non-clicked options, using a choice-based approach and time-aware preference decay. DPL leverages ASE's preference distribution to guide the conversation and adapt to preference changes for recommendations or attribute queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate VPPL's effectiveness within VPMCR, outperforming existing methods and setting a new benchmark. Our work advances CRS by accommodating users' inherent ambiguity and relative decision-making processes, improving real-world applicability.",

However, effectively modeling and adapting to users\u2019 complex and changing preferences remains challenging.

First, a graph-based Conversational Path Reasoning (CPR) framework is proposed that represents dialogs as interactive reasoning over a knowledge graph to capture nuanced user interests and explain recommendations. To further enhance relationship modeling, graph neural networks are incorporated for improved representation learning. Next, to address uncertainty in user needs, the Vague Preference Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (VPMCR) scenario and matching Adaptive Vague Preference Policy Learning (AVPPL) solution are presented using reinforcement learning to tailor recommendations to evolving preferences. Finally, opportunities to leverage large language models are discussed to further advance user experiences via advanced user modeling, policy learning, and response generation.

Existing CRS widely assumes that users have clear preferences, i.e., users have a firm belief about the fine-grained preference for one or multiple target items.

            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation system (CRS) attracts increasing attention in various application domains such as retail and travel. It offers an effective way to capture users\u2019 dynamic preferences with multi-turn conversations. However, most current studies center on the recommendation aspect while over-simplifying the conversation process. The negligence of complexity in data structure and conversation flow hinders their practicality and utility. In reality, there exist various relationships among slots and values, while users\u2019 requirements may dynamically adjust or change. Moreover, the conversation often involves visual modality to facilitate the conversation. These actually call for a more advanced internal state representation of the dialogue and a proper reasoning scheme to guide the decision making process. In this paper, we explore multiple facets of multimodal conversational recommendation and try to address the above mentioned challenges. In particular, we represent the structured back-end database as a multimodal knowledge graph which captures the various relations and evidence in different modalities. The user preferences expressed via conversation utterances will then be gradually updated to the state graph with clear polarity. Based on these, we train an end-to-end State Graph-based Reasoning model (SGR) to perform reasoning over the whole state graph. The prediction of our proposed model benefits from the structure of the graph. It not only allows for zero-shot reasoning for items unseen in training conversations, but also provides a natural way to explain the policies. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves better performance compared with existing methods.",

            "abstract": "Most existing approaches of attributed network embedding often combine topology and attribute information based on the homophily assumption. In many real-world networks, such an assumption does not hold since the nodes are usually associated with many noisy or irrelevant attributes. To tackle this issue, we propose a noise-resistant graph embedding method, called NGE, by leveraging the subspace clustering information (i.e., the formation of communities is driven by different latent features in distinct subspaces). Specifically, we first construct a tensor to represent a given attributed network and then map it into different feature subspaces to capture community structure via tensor decomposition. For structure embedding, the link-level and community-level constraints are imposed. For attribute embedding, the feature-selection constraint is used to reinforce the relationship between topology and noise-removal attributes. By learning structure and attribute embedding with subspace clustering information, NGE can benefit both community detection, link prediction, and node classification. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of NGE over many state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": "Traditional recommendation systems estimate user preference on items from past interaction history, thus suffering from the limitations of obtaining fine-grained and dynamic user preference. Conversational recommendation system (CRS) brings revolutions to those limitations by enabling the system to directly ask users about their preferred attributes on items. However, existing CRS methods do not make full use of such advantage --- they only use the attribute feedback in rather implicit ways such as updating the latent user representation. In this paper, we propose Conversational Path Reasoning (CPR), a generic framework that models conversational recommendation as an interactive path reasoning problem on a graph. It walks through the attribute vertices by following user feedback, utilizing the user preferred attributes in an explicit way. By leveraging on the graph structure, CPR is able to prune off many irrelevant candidate attributes, leading to a better chance of hitting user-preferred attributes. To demonstrate how CPR works, we propose a simple yet effective instantiation named SCPR (Simple CPR). We perform empirical studies on the multi-round conversational recommendation scenario, the most realistic CRS setting so far that considers multiple rounds of asking attributes and recommending items. Through extensive experiments on two datasets Yelp and LastFM, we validate the effectiveness of our SCPR, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CRS methods EAR and CRM. In particular, we find that the more attributes there are, the more advantages our method can achieve.",
