            "abstract": "Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time-series analytics with important implications for the downstream performance of many applications. Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed in the literature, recent benchmark and evaluation studies demonstrated that there exists no single best anomaly detection method when applied to heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will choose, based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection method to run. This paper describes ADecimo, a modular and extensible web application that helps users understand the performance of time series classification algorithms used as model selection methods for time series anomaly detection. Overall, our system enables users to compare 17 different classifiers over 1980 time series, and decide on the most suitable time series classification method for their own time series and use cases.",

            "abstract": "With the Internet of Things (IoT), a vast number of connected devices generate significant data, necessitating efficient compression techniques to manage storage costs and enhance query performance. However, \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to data compression is ineffective due to diverse applications, which vary in data characteristics, workloads, and hardware limitations. This paper introduces AdaEdge, a dynamic, hardware-conscious compression selection framework tailored for resource-constrained devices. AdaEdge is a best-effort compression selection frame- work designed to preserve application-critical information as much as possible within system constraints. It enhances the use of limited system resources through a dynamic data compression policy that considers the staleness and the significance of the data. AdaEdge applies a multi-armed bandit algorithm to assist compression selection, optimizing workload targets such as compression ratio, compression throughput, workload accuracy, or their weighted combinations. It supports both lossy and lossless compression selection, adapting to hardware constraints. It operates in both online and offline modes, addressing network constraints for edge nodes and evolving data policies to preserve workload-specific information. AdaEdge improves machine learning task accuracy by up to 30% over baseline within the same storage budget and by up to 20% in scenarios where lossless methods fall short due to low compression ratios. AdaEdge also shows robustness against data shifts and hardware variability.",

Through a novel taxonomy, measures are categorized based on how they handle the multiple variates; in an atomic or a holistic manner.

            "abstract": "\n Similarity search is a core analytical task, and its performance critically depends on the choice of distance measure. For time-series querying, elastic measures achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but are computationally expensive. Thus, fast lower bounding (LB) measures prune unnecessary comparisons with elastic distances to accelerate similarity search. Despite decades of attention, there has never been a study to assess the progress in this area. In addition, the research has disproportionately focused on one popular elastic measure, while other accurate measures have received little or no attention. Therefore, there is merit in developing a framework to accumulate knowledge from previously developed LBs and eliminate the notoriously challenging task of designing separate LBs for each elastic measure. In this paper, we perform the first comprehensive study of 11 LBs spanning 5 elastic measures using 128 datasets. We identify four properties that constitute the effectiveness of LBs and propose the Generalized Lower Bounding (GLB) framework to satisfy all desirable properties. GLB creates cache-friendly summaries, adaptively exploits summaries of both query and target time series, and captures boundary distances in an unsupervised manner. GLB outperforms\n all\n LBs in speedup (e.g., up to 13.5\u00d7 faster against the strongest LB in terms of pruning power), establishes new state-of-the-art results for the 5 elastic measures, and provides the first LBs for 2 elastic measures with no known LBs. Overall, GLB enables the effective development of LBs to facilitate fast similarity search.\n",

Despite being the subject of active research across disciplines for decades, only limited efforts focused on benchmarking clustering methods for time series. Unfortunately, these studies have (i) omitted popular methods and entire classes of methods; (ii) considered limited choices for underlying distance measures; (iii) performed evaluations on a small number of datasets; or (iv) avoided rigorous statistical validation of the findings. In addition, the sudden enthusiasm and recent slew of proposed deep learning methods underscore the vital need for a comprehensive study. Motivated by the aforementioned limitations, we present Odyssey, a modular and extensible web engine to comprehensively evaluate 80 time-series clustering methods spanning 9 different classes from the data mining, machine learning, and deep learning literature. Odyssey enables rigorous statistical analysis across 128 diverse time-series datasets. Through its interactive interface, Odyssey (i) reveals the best-performing method per class; (ii) identifies classes performing exceptionally well that were previously omitted; (iii) challenges claims about the use of elastic measures in clustering; (iv) highlights the effects of parameter tuning; and (v) debunks claims of superiority of deep learning methods. Odyssey does not only facilitate the most extensive study ever performed in this area but, importantly, reveals an illusion of progress while, in reality, none of the evaluated methods could outperform a traditional method, namely,\n k\n -Shape, with a statistically significant difference. Overall, Odyssey lays the foundations for advancing the state of the art in time-series clustering.\n",

Therefore, the only scalable and viable solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select, based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection method to run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based approaches for model selection exists.

Overall, we compare 17 different classifiers over 1800 time series, and we propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection step in general AutoML pipelines.",

            "abstract": "With the explosive growth of high-dimensional data, approximate methods emerge as promising solutions for nearest neighbor search. Among alternatives, quantization methods have gained attention due to the fast query responses and the low encoding and storage costs. Quantization methods decompose data dimensions into non-overlapping subspaces and encode data using a different dictionary per subspace. The state-of-the-art approach assigns dictionary sizes uniformly across subspaces while attempting to balance the relative importance of subspaces. Unfortunately, a uniform balance is not always achievable and may lead to unsatisfactory performance. Similarly, hardware-accelerated quantization methods may sacrifice accuracy to speed up the query execution. We propose a Variance-Aware Quantization (VAQ) method to encode data by intelligently adapting dictionary sizes to subspaces to alleviate these significant drawbacks. VAQ exploits intrinsic dimensionality reduction properties to derive the subspaces and only partially balances the importance of subspaces. Then, VAQ solves a constrained optimization problem to assign dictionary sizes proportionally to the importance of each subspace. In addition, VAQ accelerates the query execution by skipping data and subspaces through a hardware-oblivious algorithmic solution. To demonstrate the robustness of VAQ, we perform an extensive evaluation against quantization, hashing, and indexing methods using five large-scale benchmarking datasets. VAQ significantly outperforms the strongest hashing and quantization methods in accuracy while achieving up to 5\u00d7 speedup. Compared to the fastest but less accurate hardware-accelerated method, VAQ achieves a speedup@recall performance up to 14\u00d7. Importantly, a rigorous statistical comparison using over one hundred datasets reveals that VAQ significantly outperforms rival methods even with a half budget. Notably, VAQ's simple data skipping solution achieves competitive or better performance against index-based methods, highlighting the need for new indices for quantization methods.",

In this paper, we describe Theseus, a modular and extensible web application that helps users navigate through the benchmark, and reason about the merits and drawbacks of both anomaly detection methods and accuracy measures, under different conditions. Overall, our system enables users to compare 12 anomaly detection methods on 1980 time series, using 13 accuracy measures, and decide on the most suitable method and measure for some application.",
