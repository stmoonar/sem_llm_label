            "abstract": "This article introduces the Tenth Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC-10). This edition of the DSTC focuses on applying end-to-end dialog technologies for five distinct tasks in dialog systems, namely 1. Incorporation of Meme images into open domain dialogs, 2. Knowledge-grounded Task-oriented Dialogue Modeling on Spoken Conversations, 3. Situated Interactive Multimodal dialogs, 4. Reasoning for Audio Visual Scene-Aware Dialog, and 5. Automatic Evaluation and Moderation of Open-domainDialogue Systems. This article describes the task definition, provided datasets, baselines, and evaluation setup for each track. We also summarize the results of the submitted systems to highlight the general trends of the state-of-the-art technologies for the tasks.",

            "abstract": "Vision-extended LLMs have made significant strides in Visual Question Answering (VQA). Despite these advancements, VLLMs still encounter substantial difficulties in handling queries involving long-tail entities, with a tendency to produce erroneous or hallucinated responses. In this work, we introduce a novel evaluative benchmark named \\textbf{SnapNTell}, specifically tailored for entity-centric VQA. This task aims to test the models' capabilities in identifying entities and providing detailed, entity-specific knowledge. We have developed the \\textbf{SnapNTell Dataset}, distinct from traditional VQA datasets: (1) It encompasses a wide range of categorized entities, each represented by images and explicitly named in the answers; (2) It features QA pairs that require extensive knowledge for accurate responses. The dataset is organized into 22 major categories, containing 7,568 unique entities in total. For each entity, we curated 10 illustrative images and crafted 10 knowledge-intensive QA pairs. To address this novel task, we devised a scalable, efficient, and transparent retrieval-augmented multimodal LLM. Our approach markedly outperforms existing methods on the SnapNTell dataset, achieving a 66.5\\% improvement in the BELURT score. We will soon make the dataset and the source code publicly accessible.",

            "abstract": "Building an AI assistant that can seamlessly converse and instruct humans, in a user-centric situated scenario, requires several essential abilities:(1) spatial and temporal understanding of the situated and real-time user scenes,(2) capability of grounding the actively perceived visuals of users to conversation contexts,and (3) conversational reasoning over past utterances to perform just-in-time assistance.However, we currently lack a large-scale benchmark that captures user\u2013assistant interactions with all of the aforementioned features.To this end, we propose SIMMC-VR, an extension of the SIMMC-2.0 dataset, to a video-grounded task-oriented dialog dataset that captures real-world AI-assisted user scenarios in VR.We propose a novel data collection paradigm that involves(1) generating object-centric multimodal dialog flows with egocentric visual streams and visually-grounded templates,and (2) manually paraphrasing the simulated dialogs for naturalness and diversity while preserving multimodal dependencies. To measure meaningful progress in the field, we propose four tasks to address the new challenges in SIMMC-VR, which require complex spatial-temporal dialog reasoning in active egocentric scenes.We benchmark the proposed tasks with strong multimodal models, and highlight the key capabilities that current models lack for future research directions.",

We introduce several new IMU-based Wearable AI applications such as motion-based media search, or an LM-based multi-modal reasoning with motion sensor data \u2013 all using text as the grounding platform.

AnyMAL inherits the powerful text-based reasoning abilities of the state-of-the-art LLMs including LLaMA-2 (70B), and converts modality-specific signals to the joint textual space through a pre-trained aligner module. To further strengthen the multimodal LLM's capabilities, we fine-tune the model with a multimodal instruction set manually collected to cover diverse topics and tasks beyond simple QAs. We conduct comprehensive empirical analysis comprising both human and automatic evaluations, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on various multimodal tasks.",

            "abstract": "People capture photos and videos to relive and share memories of personal significance. Recently, media montages (stories) have become a popular mode of sharing these memories due to their intuitive and powerful storytelling capabilities. However, creating such montages usually involves a lot of manual searches, clicks, and selections that are time-consuming and cumbersome, adversely affecting user experiences. To alleviate this, we propose task-oriented dialogs for montage creation as a novel interactive tool to seamlessly search, compile, and edit montages from a media collection. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to leverage multi-turn conversations for such a challenging application, extending the previous literature studying simple media retrieval tasks. We collect a new dataset C3 (Conversational Content Creation), comprising 10k dialogs conditioned on media montages simulated from a large media collection. We take a simulate-and-paraphrase approach to collect these dialogs to be both cost and time efficient, while drawing from natural language distribution. Our analysis and benchmarking of state-of-the-art language models showcase the multimodal challenges present in the dataset. Lastly, we present a real-world mobile demo application that shows the feasibility of the proposed work in real-world applications. Our code and data will be made publicly available.",

We explore several new IMU-based applications that IMU2CLIP enables, such as motion-based media retrieval and natural language reasoning tasks with motion data. In addition, we show that IMU2CLIP can significantly improve the downstream performance when fine-tuned for each application (e.g. activity recognition), demonstrating the universal usage of IMU2CLIP as a new pre-trained resource.

            "abstract": "Recent years have seen an increasing trend in the volume of personal media captured by users, thanks to the advent of smartphones and smart glasses, resulting in large media collections. Despite conversation being an intuitive human-computer interface, current efforts focus mostly on single-shot natural language based media retrieval to aid users query their media and re-live their memories. This severely limits the search functionality as users can neither ask follow-up queries nor obtain information without first formulating a single-turn query.In this work, we propose dialogs for connected memories as a powerful tool to empower users to search their media collection through a multi-turn, interactive conversation. Towards this, we collect a new task-oriented dialog dataset COMET, which contains 11.5k user\u2194assistant dialogs (totalling 103k utterances), grounded in simulated personal memory graphs. We employ a resource-efficient, two-phase data collection pipeline that uses: (1) a novel multimodal dialog simulator that generates synthetic dialog flows grounded in memory graphs, and, (2) manual paraphrasing to obtain natural language utterances. We analyze COMET, formulate four main tasks to benchmark meaningful progress, and adopt state-of-the-art language models as strong baselines, in order to highlight the multimodal challenges captured by our dataset.",

To overcome, we present a new dataset for Situated and Interactive Multimodal Conversations, SIMMC 2.0, which includes 11K task-oriented user<->assistant dialogs (117K utterances) in the shopping domain, grounded in immersive and photo-realistic scenes. The dialogs are collection using a two-phase pipeline: (1) A novel multimodal dialog simulator generates simulated dialog flows, with an emphasis on diversity and richness of interactions, (2) Manual paraphrasing of generating utterances to draw from natural language distribution. We provide an in-depth analysis of the collected dataset, and describe in detail the four main benchmark tasks we propose for SIMMC 2.0.
