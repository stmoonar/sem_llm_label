            "abstract": "Communication network failure, e.g., persistent packet loss, may considerably affect the safe and stable operation of smart grids. This may degrade the performance of various components and applications, including energy management and economic dispatch. We propose a switched surplus-based distributed security dispatch approach to cope with the persistent packet loss under an unreliable communication network environment. First, we jointly consider the packet loss sequence and the dynamic triggering sequence to define actual affected periods caused by the persistent packet loss. Then, we outline an incentive scheme, integrate primal-dual analysis and eigenvalue perturbation theory to design the switched surplus-based distributed security dispatch algorithm. Further, we design a dynamic triggering mechanism that enables the proposed algorithm to dynamically switch to different modes according to the change in network state. With those components, the proposed method offers strong robustness against persistent packet loss. In addition, we provide the convergence and optimality proofs of the algorithm. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the proposed method and to demonstrate its effectiveness.",

            "abstract": "Explainability of AI models is an important topic that can have a significant impact in all domains and applications from autonomous driving to healthcare. The existing approaches to explainable AI (XAI) are mainly limited to simple machine learning algorithms, and the research regarding the explainability-accuracy tradeoff is still in its infancy especially when we are concerned about complex machine learning techniques like neural networks and deep learning (DL). In this work, we introduce a new approach for complex models based on the co-relation impact which enhances the explainability considerably while also ensuring the accuracy at a high level. We propose approaches for both scenarios of independent features and dependent features. In addition, we study the uncertainty associated with features and output. Furthermore, we provide an upper bound of the computation complexity of our proposed approach for the dependent features. The complexity bound depends on the order of logarithmic of the number of observations which provides a reliable result considering the higher dimension of dependent feature space with a smaller number of observations.",

            "abstract": "The dramatically growing trend of vehicles equipped with driving camera recorders has allowed realizing real-time crowdsourced video sharing in vehicular edge computing (VEC). Such cameras can assist in monitoring objects directly in front of and behind the vehicles, enabling them to provide important visual information through real-time video streaming in case of possible accidents. Exploiting the on-board units (OBUs) for VEC can allow drivers and passengers to share and access on-road video surveillance services. However, data security and privacy concerns of video generators (owners) are two key challenges that can severely limit video sharing in a VEC environment. In this article, we propose a blockchain empowered publish/subscribe (P/S) scheme to enable one-to-many secure video sharing in the VEC scenario. Then, we design an attribute-based encryption algorithm with static and dynamic attributes (ABE-SD) to achieve fine-grained access control in a mobile environment. Finally, We utilize permissioned blockchain and smart contracts to record access policy and publish and subscribe events, thus resulting in user self-certification and event traceability. The numerical results indicate that our proposed scheme ABE-SD outperforms traditional centralized CP-ABE methods in terms of encryption and decryption performance. The simulation experiments demonstrated that the proposed video-sharing scheme is secure and efficient.",

            "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (EVs) poses a significant challenge for the power grid operator in terms of increasing peak load and power quality reduction. Moreover, there is a growing demand for fast charging services in smart grids. Addressing the growing demand from fast charging services is challenging. To overcome this challenge, in this article, we propose a new computational architecture combining energy trading and demand responses based on cloud computing for managing virtual power plants (VPPs) in smart grids. In the proposed system, EVs can be charged at high charging rates without affecting the operation of the power grid by purchasing energy through the energy trading platform in the cloud. In addition, users with storage devices can sell energy surplus to the market. On the one hand, the energy trading platform can be regarded as an internal market of the VPP that aims to maximize its revenue. The interest of the EV owners, on the other hand, is to minimize the cost for charging. Therefore, we model the interactions between the EV owners and the VPP as a non-cooperative game. To search for the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game, we design an algorithm and then analyze its computational complexity and communication overhead. We utilize real data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Our results illustrate that the users with only storage devices can obtain nearly <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$200\\%$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>200</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"chung-ieq1-3118563.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> higher revenue on average by participating in the proposed internal market.

            "abstract": "Energy saving for mobile devices is considered to be one of prospective benefits of mobile edge computing (MEC) networks, where computation-intensive tasks can be offloaded from the mobile devices to their associated MEC servers for execution. Extra energy consumption for data migration should therefore be less than the energy consumption for local execution. However, in multi-cell MEC-assisted networks, due to both the presence of co-channel interference and the latency requirement of each offloading task, power control is tightly coupled with computation offloading, which becomes an obstacle to achieve the aim of energy saving. In this paper, we develop an analytic model to decouple power control and computation resource allocation from each other, in which the transmission power can be considered as a solution to a set of linear equations with a coefficient matrix depending on the computation resource budget. Based on this analytic foundation, we show that with a fixed offloading decision, the joint power control and computation resource allocation problem is invex, which ensures that every KKT (Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker) stationary point of the problem must be a global minimizer. Moreover, we deduce a criterion for energy-efficient offloading decision making from the partial derivative of the total energy consumption of mobile devices with respect to the computation resource budget. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithms to jointly optimizing power and computation resource allocation, and offloading decision. The numerical results demonstrate the optimality and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.",

Although vehicular edge caching can facilitate delay-bounded content transmission, constrained storage capacity and limited serving range of an individual cache server as well as highly dynamic topology of vehicular networks may degrade the efficiency of content delivery. To address the problem, in this article, we propose a social-aware vehicular edge caching mechanism that dynamically orchestrates the cache capability of roadside units (RSUs) and smart vehicles according to user preference similarity and service availability. Furthermore, catering to the complexity and variability of vehicular social characteristics, we leverage the digital twin technology to map the edge caching system into virtual space, which facilitates constructing the social relation model. Based on the social model, a new concept of vehicular cache cloud is developed to incorporate the correlation of content storing between multiple cache-enabled vehicles in diverse traffic environments. Then, we propose deep learning empowered optimal caching schemes, jointly considering the social model construction, cache cloud formation, and cache resource allocation. We evaluate the proposed schemes based on real traffic data. Numerical results demonstrate that our edge caching schemes have great advantages in optimizing caching utility.",

            "abstract": "The distributed and heterogeneous framework in the 5G heterogeneous network (Het-Net) makes it vulnerable to attacks of different kinds. Nodes for improving the network security are therefore important to eliminate such critical threats. Without cooperation or with limited cooperation, these nodes are substantially restricted in their protecting capacity due to specific characteristics such as heterogeneity, hierarchy, and wide range in the 5G HetNet. In this article, we propose a federated learning empowered end-edge-cloud cooperation-based framework for enhancing 5G HetNet security. In this framework, nodes equipped with attack detection mechanisms are distributed in the end, edge, and cloud of the 5G HetNet. We then design cooperative training schemes to realize the full potential of these nodes in detecting attacks. Illustrative results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared to three different benchmark schemes.",

            "abstract": "Sixth-generation (6G) is envisioned to be characterized by ubiquitous connectivity, extremely low latency, and enhanced edge intelligence. However, enriching 6G with these features requires addressing new, unique, and complex challenges specifically at the edge of the network. In this article, we propose a wireless digital twin edge network model by integrating digital twin with edge networks to enable new functionalities, such as hyper-connected experience and low-latency edge computing. To efficiently construct and maintain digital twins in the wireless digital twin network, we formulate the edge association problem with respect to the dynamic network states and varying network topology. Furthermore, according to the different running stages, we decompose the problem into two subproblems, including digital twin placement and digital twin migration. Moreover, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to find the optimal solution to the digital twin placement problem, and then use transfer learning to solve the digital twin migration problem. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme provides reduced system cost and enhanced convergence rate for dynamic network states.",

            "abstract": "Emerging technologies, such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and next-generation communications are crucial for enabling rapid development and deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). With the increasing scale of IoT networks, how to optimize the network and allocate the limited resources to provide high-quality services remains a major concern. The existing work in this direction mainly relies on models that are of less practical value for resource-limited IoT networks, and can hardly simulate the dynamic systems in real time. In this article, we integrate digital twins with edge networks and propose the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) to fill the gap between physical edge networks and digital systems. Then, we propose a blockchain-empowered federated learning scheme to strengthen communication security and data privacy protection in DITEN. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the integrated scheme, we propose an asynchronous aggregation scheme and use digital twin empowered reinforcement learning to schedule relaying users and allocate spectrum resources. Theoretical analysis and numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can considerably enhance both communication efficiency and data security for IoT applications.",
