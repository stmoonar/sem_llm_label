            "abstract": "Fashion analysis refers to the process of examining and evaluating trends, styles, and elements within the fashion industry to understand and interpret its current state, generating fashion reports. It is traditionally performed by fashion professionals based on their expertise and experience, which requires high labour cost and may also produce biased results for relying heavily on a small group of people. In this paper, to tackle the Fashion Report Generation (FashionReGen) task, we propose an intelligent Fashion Analyzing and Reporting system based the advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), debbed as GPT-FAR. Specifically, it tries to deliver FashionReGen based on effective catwalk analysis, the proposed GPT-FAR system is equipped with several key procedures, namely, catwalk understanding, collective organization and analysis, and report generation. By posing and exploring such an open-ended, complex and domain-specific task of FashionReGen, it is able to test the general capability of LLMs in fashion domain. It also inspires the explorations of more high-level tasks with industrial significance in other domains. Video illustration and more materials of GPT-FAR can be found in https://github.com/CompFashion/FashionReGen.",

            "abstract": "Personalized fashion matching task aims to predict the compatible fashion items given available ones for specific users through the effective modeling of the third-order interaction patterns among the user and item pairs. To achieve this, previous methods separately model two key components, user-item and item-item relationships, which ignore the inherent correlations between them and lead to undesirable performance. With a new perspective, this paper proposes to formulate the personalized item matching as the multi-relational connectivity and apply a single-component translation operation to model the targeted third-order interactions. With user-item-item interactions naturally constructing a multi-relational graph, we further device two graph learning modules to enhance the translation-based matching approach from two perspectives,C ontext and Path. The proposed method, named CP-TransMatch, has been tested with extensive experiments on three benchmark fashion datasets and proven effective. It sets the new SOTA for the personalized fashion matching task.",

In terms of complementary recommendation, existing approaches were dedicated to modeling either product compatibility or users\u2019 personalization in a direct and decoupled manner, yet overlooked additional relations hidden within historical user-product interactions. In this paper, we propose a Normalized indirect Personal Compatibility modeling scheme based on Bayesian Personalized Ranking (NiPC-BPR) for mix-and-match clothing recommendations. We exploit direct and indirect personalization and compatibility relations from the user and product interactions, and effectively integrate various multi-modal data.

            "abstract": "Fashion recommendation is a key research field in computational fashion research and has attracted considerable interest in the computer vision, multimedia, and information retrieval communities in recent years. Due to the great demand for applications, various fashion recommendation tasks, such as personalized fashion product recommendation, complementary (mix-and-match) recommendation, and outfit recommendation, have been posed and explored in the literature. The continuing research attention and advances impel us to look back and in-depth into the field for a better understanding. In this article, we comprehensively review recent research efforts on fashion recommendation from a technological perspective. We first introduce fashion recommendation at a macro level and analyze its characteristics and differences with general recommendation tasks. We then clearly categorize different fashion recommendation efforts into several sub-tasks and focus on each sub-task in terms of its problem formulation, research focus, state-of-the-art methods, and limitations. We also summarize the datasets proposed in the literature for use in fashion recommendation studies to give readers a brief illustration. Finally, we discuss several promising directions for future research in this field. Overall, this survey systematically reviews the development of fashion recommendation research. It also discusses the current limitations and gaps between academic research and the real needs of the fashion industry. In the process, we offer a deep insight into how the fashion industry could benefit from the computational technologies of fashion recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Modelling the coherence of information is important for human to perceive and prehend the physical world. Existing works on coherence modelling mainly focus on single modality, which overlook the effect of information integration and semantic consistency across modalities. To fill the research gap, this paper targets at the cross-modal coherence modelling, specifically, the cross-modal ordering task. The task requires to not only explore the coherence information in single modality, but also leverage cross-modal information to model the semantic consistency between modalities. To this end, we propose a Non-Autoregressive Cross-modal Ordering Net (NACON) adopting a basic encoder-decoder architecture. Specifically, NACON is equipped with an order-invariant context encoder to model the unordered input set and a non-autoregressive decoder to generate ordered sequences in parallel. We devise a cross-modal positional attention module in NACON to take advantage of the cross-modal order guidance. To alleviate the repetition problem of non-autoregressive models, we introduce an elegant exclusive loss to constrain the ordering exclusiveness between positions and elements. We conduct extensive experiments on two assembled datasets to support our task, SIND and TACoS-Ordering. Experimental results show that the proposed NACON can effectively leverage cross-modal guidance and recover the correct order of the elements.The code is available at https://github.com/YiBin-CHN/CMCM.",

            "abstract": "Fashion recommendation, aiming to explore specific user preference in fashion, has become an important research topic for its practical significance to the fashion business sector. However, little work has been done on an important sub-task called sequential fashion recommendation, which aims to capture additional short-term fashion interest of users by modeling the item-to-item transitions. In this paper, we propose a novel Attentional Content-level Translation-based Recommender (ACTR) framework, which simultaneously models the instant user intent of each transition and the intent-specific transition probability. Specifically, we define instant intent with the relationships between adjacent items that the users interacted, which are the three fundamental domain-specific relationships of: match, substitute and others. To further exploit the characteristics of fashion domain and alleviate the item transition sparsity problem, we augment the item-level transition modeling with multiple sub-transitions using various content-level attributes. An attention mechanism is further devised to effectively aggregate multiple content-level transitions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that specifies the implicit user actions in online fashion shopping with explicit instant intent, which enhances the connectivity of fashion items and boosts the recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on two real-world fashion E-commerce datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in sequential fashion recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Sequential fashion recommendation is of great significance in online fashion shopping, which accounts for an increasing portion of either fashion retailing or online e-commerce. The key to building an effective sequential fashion recommendation model lies in capturing two types of patterns: the personal fashion preference of users and the transitional relationships between adjacent items. The two types of patterns are usually related to user-item interaction and item-item transition modeling respectively. However, due to the large sets of users and items as well as the sparse historical interactions, it is difficult to train an effective and efficient sequential fashion recommendation model. To tackle these problems, we propose to leverage two types of global graph, i.e., the user-item interaction graph and item-item transition graph, to obtain enhanced user and item representations by incorporating higher-order connections over the graphs. In addition, we adopt the graph kernel of LightGCN [9] for the information propagation in both graphs and propose a new design for item-item transition graph. Extensive experiments on two established sequential fashion recommendation datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.",

            "abstract": "This companion paper supports the replication of the fashion trend forecasting experiments with the KERN (Knowledge Enhanced Recurrent Network) method that we presented in the ICMR 2020. We provide an artifact that allows the replication of the experiments using a Python implementation. The artifact is easy to deploy with simple installation, training and evaluation. We reproduce the experiments conducted in the original paper and obtain similar performance as previously reported. The replication results of the experiments support the main claims in the original paper.",
