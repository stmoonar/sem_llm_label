            "title": "A Survey on Bid Optimization in Real-Time Bidding Display Advertising",
            "abstract": "Real-Time Bidding (RTB) is one of the most important forms of online advertising, where an auction is hosted in real time to sell the individual ad impression. How to design an automated bidding strategy in response to the dynamic auction environment is crucial for improving user experience, protecting the interests of advertisers, and promoting the long-term development of the advertising platform. As an exciting topic in the real-world industry, it has attracted great research interest from several disciplines, most notably data science. There have been abundant studies on bidding strategy design which are based on the large volume of historical ad requests. Despite its popularity and significance, few works provide a summary for bid optimization. In this survey, we present the latest overview of the recent works to shed light on the optimization techniques where most of them are validated in practice. We first explore the optimization problem in different works, explaining how these different settings affect the bidding strategy designs. Then, some forms of bidding functions and specific optimization techniques are illustrated. Further, we specifically discuss a new trend about bidding in first-price auctions, which have gradually become popular in recent years. From this survey, both practitioners and researchers can gain insights of the challenges and future prospects of bid optimization in RTB.",

            "title": "Deep Landscape Forecasting in Multi-Slot Real-Time Bidding",
            "abstract": "Real-Time Bidding (RTB) has shown remarkable success in display advertising and has been employed in other advertising scenarios, e.g., sponsored search advertising with multiple ad slots. Many current RTB techniques built for single-slot display advertising are thus no longer applicable, especially in the bid landscape forecasting. Landscape forecasting predicts market competition, including the highest bid price and winning probability, which is preliminary and crucial for the subsequent bidding strategy design. In the multi-slot advertising, predicting the winning prices for each position requires a more precise differentiation of bids among top advertisers. Furthermore, defining the winning probability and addressing censorship issues are not as straightforward as in the case of a single slot. In view of these challenges, how to forecast the bidding landscape in the multi-slot environment remains open. In this work, we are the first to study the landscape forecasting problem in multi-slot RTB, considering the correlation between ad slots in the same pageview. Specifically, we formulate the research topic into two subproblems: predicting the distribution of the winning price and predicting the winning probability of the bid price for each position. Based on the observation from the production data and survival analysis techniques, we propose a deep recurrent model to predict the distribution of the winning price as well as the winning probability for each position. A comprehensive loss function is proposed to learn from the censoring data. Experiments on two public semi-synthetic datasets and one private industrial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

            "title": "Optimal Real-Time Bidding Strategy for Position Auctions in Online Advertising",
            "abstract": "Position auctions are widely studied in the context of sponsored search advertising, where multiple ad slots are sold in a single auction. In traditional sponsored search, bids are submitted at the keyword level, while recent works have explored transitioning to impression-level bidding using Real-Time Bidding (RTB) techniques to achieve finer bidding. However, position auctions introduce varying user appeal across different positions and more dynamic auction landscape, which RTB, originally devised for single-slot display advertising, fails to address adequately. In this work, we are the first to study the optimal bidding strategy for position auctions in RTB. The position auctions we study belong to a broader class, including both sponsored search and display advertising with multiple ad slots. In particular, we aim at maximizing the advertising value within the budget constraint for an advertiser. We mathematically formulate the problem with explicit modeling of position effects. By leveraging the Lagrange multiplier, we derive the optimal bid price and prove its uniqueness under mild assumptions. Efficient numeric methods are applied to obtain the solution practically. Extensive experiments are conducted on a public semi-synthetic dataset and a private industry dataset to validate the effectiveness and feasibility in practice.",
