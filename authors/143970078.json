            "abstract": "Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) protocols have recently been extensively used by distributed and decentralized data management systems with non-trustworthy infrastructures to establish consensus on the order of transactions. BFT protocols cover a broad spectrum of design dimensions from infrastructure settings, such as the communication topology, to more technical features, such as commitment strategy and even fundamental social choice properties like order-fairness. The proliferation of different protocols has made it difficult to navigate the BFT landscape, let alone determine the protocol that best meets application needs. In this tutorial, we discuss BFT protocols that are used in modern large-scale data management systems, present a design space consisting of a set of design dimensions and explore several design choices that capture the trade-offs between different design space dimensions. The presented design space and its design choices will help developers analyze BFT protocols, understand how different protocols are related to each other, and find the protocol that best fits their needs.",

            "abstract": "Database queries traditionally operate under the closed-world assumption, providing no answers to questions that require information beyond the data stored in the database. Hybrid querying using SQL offers an alternative by integrating relational databases with large language models (LLMs) to answer beyond-database questions. In this paper, we present the first cross-domain benchmark, SWAN, containing 120 beyond-database questions over four real-world databases. To leverage state-of-the-art language models in addressing these complex questions in SWAN, we present, HQDL, a preliminary solution for hybrid querying, and also discuss potential future directions. Our evaluation demonstrates that HQDL using GPT-4 Turbo with few-shot prompts, achieves 40.0\\% in execution accuracy and 48.2\\% in data factuality. These results highlights both the potential and challenges for hybrid querying. We believe that our work will inspire further research in creating more efficient and accurate data systems that seamlessly integrate relational databases and large language models to address beyond-database questions.",

            "abstract": "Since the advent of cloud computing, storing large quantities of sensitive data on remote services have demanded secure encryption practices to maintain data privacy. Merely encrypting data at-rest leaves ciphertexts vulnerable to inevitable key leakage from mismanaged keys, side-channel attacks, and security bugs. To combat this, we propose QUICKeR, a system to facilitate continuous key rotation and ciphertext updates. Unfortunately, continuous ciphertext updates from key rotation interferes with routine access operations by introducing race conditions and performance bottlenecks that preclude prior works from practical use. QUICKeR addresses these concerns through protocols that eliminate race conditions and even achieve the stronger linearizability correctness criterion. In addition, QUICKeR proposes three approaches to implement frequent ciphertext updates. We show how these different update schemes perform under different database bottlenecks. Finally, we demonstrate that QUICKeR is practical through end-to-end experiments showing that routine access operations are not significantly impacted by ciphertext update operations.",

            "title": "ORTOA: A Family of One Round Trip Protocols For Operation-Type Obliviousness",
            "abstract": "Many applications relying on cloud storage services typically encrypt their data to ensure data privacy. However, serving client requests by reading or writing the encrypted data reveals the type of client operation to a potentially untrusted cloud. An adversary can exploit this information leak to compromise a user\u2019s privacy by tracking read/write access patterns. Existing approaches such as Oblivious RAM (ORAM) schemes hide the type of client access by always reading and then writing the data sequentially for both reads and writes, rendering one of these rounds redundant with respect to a client request. To mitigate this redundancy, we propose ORTOA-a family of protocols enabling single-round data access on remote storage without revealing the operation type . Specifically, we propose three protocols, two using existing cryptographic primitives of fully homomorphic encryption and trusted execution environments (TEEs), and a new primitive inspired by garbled circuits. Each of these protocols has different trust assumptions, allowing an application to choose the option best suited for its needs. To our knowledge, ORTOA is the first to propose generalized protocols to obfuscate the type of access in a single round, reducing communication overhead by half. The proposed techniques can pave the way for novel ORAM schemes that hide both the type of access and the access pattern in a single round. Our experimental results show ORTOA achieving throughput gains of 1.7x-3.2x compared to a baseline requiring two rounds for access type hiding, with the baseline incurring latency 1.5-1.9x that of ORTOA for 160B-sized objects.",

One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

Waffle achieves this without prior knowledge of the input data access distribution, making it the first of its kind to adaptively handle input sequences under a passive persistent adversary. Waffle maintains a constant bandwidth and client-side storage overhead, which can be adjusted to suit the application owner's preferences. This flexibility allows the owner to fine-tune system parameters and strike a balance between security and performance. Our evaluation, utilizing the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) benchmark and Redis as the backend storage, demonstrates promising results. The insecure baseline outperforms Waffle by a mere 5-6x, whereas Waffle outperforms Pancake-a state-of-the-art oblivious datastore under passive persistent adversaries-by 45-57%, and a concurrent ORAM system, TaoStore, by 102x.",

            "abstract": "Edge computing while bringing computation and data closer to users in order to improve response time, distributes edge servers in wide area networks resulting in increased communication latency between the servers. Synchronizing globally distributed edge servers, especially in the presence of Byzantine servers, becomes costly due to the high communication complexity of Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols. In this paper, we present Ziziphus, a geo-distributed system that partitions edge servers into fault-tolerant zones where each zone processes transactions initiated by nearby clients locally. Global synchronization among zones is required only in special situations, e.g., migration of clients from one zone to another. On the one hand, the two-level architecture of Ziziphus confines the malicious behavior of nodes within zones requiring a much cheaper protocol at the top level for global synchronization. On the other hand, Ziziphus processes local transactions within zones by edge servers closer to clients resulting in enhanced performance. Ziziphus further introduces zone clusters to enhance scalability where instead of running global synchronization among all zones, only zones of a single cluster are synchronized.",

            "abstract": "System operators are often interested in extracting different feature streams from multi-dimensional data streams; and reporting their distributions at regular intervals, including the heavy hitters that contribute to the tail portion of the feature distribution. Satisfying these requirements to increase data rates with limited resources is challenging. This paper presents the design and implementation of Panakos that makes the best use of available resources to report a given feature's distribution accurately, its tail contributors, and other stream statistics (e.g., cardinality, entropy, etc.). Our key idea is to leverage the skewness inherent to most feature streams in the real world. We leverage this skewness by disentangling the feature stream into hot, warm, and cold items based on their feature values. We then use different data structures for tracking objects in each category. Panakos provides solid theoretical guarantees and achieves high performance for various tasks. We have implemented Panakos on both software and hardware and compared Panakos to other state-of-the-art sketches using synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that Panakos often achieves one order of magnitude better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solutions for a given memory budget.",
