            "title": "Beyond Single Items: Exploring User Preferences in Item Sets with the Conversational Playlist Curation Dataset",
            "abstract": "Users in consumption domains, like music, are often able to more efficiently provide preferences over a set of items (e.g. a playlist or radio) than over single items (e.g. songs). Unfortunately, this is an underexplored area of research, with most existing recommendation systems limited to understanding preferences over single items. Curating an item set exponentiates the search space that recommender systems must consider (all subsets of items!): this motivates conversational approaches-where users explicitly state or refine their preferences and systems elicit preferences in natural language-as an efficient way to understand user needs. We call this task conversational item set curation and present a novel data collection methodology that efficiently collects realistic preferences about item sets in a conversational setting by observing both item-level and set-level feedback. We apply this methodology to music recommendation to build the Conversational Playlist Curation Dataset (CPCD), where we show that it leads raters to express preferences that would not be otherwise expressed. Finally, we propose a wide range of conversational retrieval models as baselines for this task and evaluate them on the dataset.",

            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRSs) enable users to use natural language feedback to control their recommendations, overcoming many of the challenges of traditional recommendation systems. However, the practical adoption of CRSs remains limited due to a lack of rich and diverse conversational training data that pairs user utterances with recommendations. To address this problem, we introduce a new method to generate synthetic training data by transforming curated item collections, such as playlists or movie watch lists, into item-seeking conversations. First, we use a biased random walk to generate a sequence of slates, or sets of item recommendations; then, we use a language model to generate corresponding user utterances. We demonstrate our approach by generating a conversational music recommendation dataset with over one million conversations, which were found to be consistent with relevant recommendations by a crowdsourced evaluation. Using the synthetic data to train a CRS, we significantly outperform standard retrieval baselines in offline and online evaluations.",

This has motivated conversational recommender systems (CRSs), with control provided through natural language feedback. However, as with most application domains, building robust CRSs requires training data that reflects system usage$\\unicode{x2014}$here conversations with user utterances paired with items that cover a wide range of preferences. This has proved challenging to collect scalably using conventional methods. We address the question of whether it can be generated synthetically, building on recent advances in natural language. We evaluate in the setting of item set recommendation, noting the increasing attention to this task motivated by use cases like music, news, and recipe recommendation. We present TalkTheWalk, which synthesizes realistic high-quality conversational data by leveraging domain expertise encoded in widely available curated item collections, generating a sequence of hypothetical yet plausible item sets, then using a language model to produce corresponding user utterances. We generate over one million diverse playlist curation conversations in the music domain, and show these contain consistent utterances with relevant item sets nearly matching the quality of an existing but small human-collected dataset for this task. We demonstrate the utility of the generated synthetic dataset on a conversational item retrieval task and show that it improves over both unsupervised baselines and systems trained on a real dataset.",

This paper presents MuLan: a first attempt at a new generation of acoustic models that link music audio directly to unconstrained natural language music descriptions. MuLan takes the form of a two-tower, joint audio-text embedding model trained using 44 million music recordings (370K hours) and weakly-associated, free-form text annotations. Through its compatibility with a wide range of music genres and text styles (including conventional music tags), the resulting audio-text representation subsumes existing ontologies while graduating to true zero-shot functionalities. We demonstrate the versatility of the MuLan embeddings with a range of experiments including transfer learning, zero-shot music tagging, language understanding in the music domain, and cross-modal retrieval applications.",

            "abstract": "We consider a sequential decision-making problem where an agent can take one action at a time and each action has a stochastic temporal extent, i.e., a new action cannot be taken until the previous one is finished. Upon completion, the chosen action yields a stochastic reward. The agent seeks to maximize its cumulative reward over a finite time budget, with the option of \"giving up\" on a current action -- hence forfeiting any reward -- in order to choose another action. We cast this problem as a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandits problem with stochastic consumption of resource. For this problem, we first establish that the optimal arm is the one that maximizes the ratio of the expected reward of the arm to the expected waiting time before the agent sees the reward due to pulling that arm. Using a novel upper confidence bound on this ratio, we then introduce an upper confidence based-algorithm, WAIT-UCB, for which we establish logarithmic, problem-dependent regret bound which has an improved dependence on problem parameters compared to previous works. Simulations on various problem configurations comparing WAIT-UCB against the state-of-the-art algorithms are also presented.",

Dynamic pricing involves changing the price of items on a regular basis, and uses the feedback from the pricing decisions to update prices of the items. Most popular approaches to dynamic pricing use a passive learning approach, where the algorithm uses historical data to learn various parameters of the pricing problem, and uses the updated parameters to generate a new set of prices. We show that one can use active learning algorithms such as Thompson sampling to more efficiently learn the underlying parameters in a pricing problem. We apply our algorithms to a real e-commerce system and show that the algorithms indeed improve revenue compared to pricing algorithms that use passive learning.",

Estimation in this context requires learning both the feature weights and the nonlinear function that relates features to observations. While methods have been described to learn SIMs in the low dimensional regime, a method that can efficiently learn SIMs in high dimensions, and under general structural assumptions, has not been forthcoming. In this paper, we propose computationally efficient algorithms for SIM inference in high dimensions with structural constraints. Our general approach specializes to sparsity, group sparsity, and low-rank assumptions among others. Experiments show that the proposed method enjoys superior predictive performance when compared to generalized linear models, and achieves results comparable to or better than single layer feedforward neural networks with significantly less computational cost.\n \n",

            "abstract": "In this paper we model the problem of learning preferences of a population as an active learning problem. We propose an algorithm can adaptively choose pairs of items to show to users coming from a heterogeneous population, and use the obtained reward to decide which pair of items to show next. We provide computationally efficient algorithms with provable sample complexity guarantees for this problem in both the noiseless and noisy cases. In the process of establishing sample complexity guarantees for our algorithms, we establish new results using a Nystr{\\\"o}m-like method which can be of independent interest. We supplement our theoretical results with experimental comparisons.",
