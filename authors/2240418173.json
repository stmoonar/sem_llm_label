            "abstract": "Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is an innovative transportation system that will provide safe and efficient mobility of cargo, passenger and emergency services in low-altitude airspace. This paper highlights AAM's vision and addresses fundamental research challenges and opportunities, e.g., vertical lift aircraft technologies, infrastructure and operation, unmanned traffic management and system security. The overall structure of the AAM ecosystem is discussed from a technology and service perspective. The SEEDS evaluation criteria for the AAM system are explored in terms of promoting safety, sustainability and service quality during the development, verification and validation, and operation phases. As a key sector of the Mobility 5.0 paradigm, new air mobility needs to be integrated into multimodal transport and logistics systems to deliver diverse, sustainable and trustworthy solutions in the near future.",

            "abstract": "It is generally recognized that accurate and timely prediction of future traffic flow information is one of the important conditions for improving the utilization rate of road networks and relieving traffic congestion. Since long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have obvious advantages in dealing with time series data, LSTM-based prediction models, as well as the improved and hybrid models based on LSTM, have been widely used in the field of traffic flow prediction and have achieved a series of important results. However, although some existing reviews have provided a comprehensive summary of and prospects for traffic flow prediction methods, there is no recent review specifically summarizing the traffic flow prediction methods based on LSTM. Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive review of LSTM-based methods for traffic flow prediction. First, we briefly introduce the development history of traffic flow prediction, the advantages of using LSTM for traffic flow prediction, and the basic principles of LSTM. Then, the representative model structures, training methods, public datasets, attractive results, the advantages and disadvantages of different LSTM-based methods are presented and analyzed in detail. Furthermore, to illustrate the performance of various refinements and hybrid models based on LSTM for traffic flow prediction, we meticulously select several representative approaches to conduct comparative experiments and quantitative analysis. Finally, we discuss the current limitations and challenges of LSTM and traffic flow prediction and present potential areas of future research interest to the readers.",

            "abstract": "To handle two shortcomings of existing methods, (i) nearly all models rely on the high-definition (HD) maps, yet the map information is not always available in real traffic scenes since map-building is expensive and time-consuming and (ii) existing models usually improve prediction accuracy at the expense of reducing computing efficiency, yet the efficiency is crucial for various real applications, this paper proposes an efficient trajectory prediction model that is not dependent on traffic maps. The core idea of our model is to encode single-agent's spatial-temporal information in the first stage and explore multi-agents' spatial-temporal interactions in the second stage. By comprehensively utilizing attention mechanism, long short-term memory, graph convolutional network, and temporal transformer to decouple spatial and temporal features on both the single agent and the multiple agents level, our model is able to learn rich dynamic and interaction information of all agents. Our model achieves the highest performance when comparing with existing map-free methods and exceeds most map-based state-of-the-art methods on the Argoverse and nuScenes datasets. In addition, our model also exhibits a faster inference speed than many state-of-the-art models.",

However, the harsh environment and complex conditions in open-pit mines present substantial challenges for the implementation of autonomous transportation systems. This research introduces a novel paradigm that integrates Scenario Engineering (SE) with autonomous transportation systems to significantly improve the trustworthiness, robustness, and efficiency in open-pit mines by incorporating the four key components of SE, including Scenario Feature Extractor, Intelligence and Index, Calibration and Certification, and Verification and Validation. This paradigm has been validated in two famous open-pit mines, the experiment results demonstrate marked improvements in robustness, trustworthiness, and efficiency.

            "abstract": "Path planning plays a vital role in ensuring the efficient and safe operation of off-road autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs). Current methods mostly focus on minimizing the travel time or path length of AGVs and often overlook the fact that the AGVs could fail in many ways during the operation due to stochastic and rough terrain conditions. The objective of this article is to not only generate a proper path for the vehicle but also ensure that the planned path is overall reliable and safe for the vehicle with complex terrain conditions. To achieve this goal, this article develops a reliability-based mission planning method for off-road AGVs subject to two failure modes in terms of mobility (the maximum attainable speed and vehicle vertical acceleration) induced by the uncertain ground properties of the terrain. A physics-based vehicle dynamics simulation model is first employed to predict vehicle mobility for any given terrain conditions of a path. Mobility reliability of an AGV is then analyzed using surrogate modeling methods considering uncertainty sources in the off-road terrain conditions. After that, the reliability constraints for the two failure modes are integrated with the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) algorithm to identify an optimal path, which is the shortest path while satisfying the reliability requirements of the two considered failure modes. Results of a case study demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods for path planning with the consideration of uncertainty in the deformable terrain.",
