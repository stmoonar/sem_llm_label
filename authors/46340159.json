            "title": "Practical Bandits: An Industry Perspective",
            "abstract": "The bandit paradigm provides a unified modeling framework for problems that require decision-making under uncertainty. Because many business metrics can be viewed as rewards (a.k.a. utilities) that result from actions, bandit algorithms have seen a large and growing interest from industrial applications, such as search, recommendation and advertising. Indeed, with the bandit lens comes the promise of direct optimisation for the metrics we care about. Nevertheless, the road to successfully applying bandits in production is not an easy one. Even when the action space and rewards are well-defined, practitioners still need to make decisions regarding multi-arm or contextual approaches, on- or off-policy setups, delayed or immediate feedback, myopic or long-term optimisation, etc. To make matters worse, industrial platforms typically give rise to large action spaces in which existing approaches tend to break down. The research literature on these topics is broad and vast, but this can overwhelm practitioners, whose primary aim is to solve practical problems, and therefore need to decide on a specific instantiation or approach for each project. This tutorial will take a step towards filling that gap between the theory and practice of bandits. Our goal is to present a unified overview of the field and its existing terminology, concepts and algorithms---with a focus on problems relevant to industry. We hope our industrial perspective will help future practitioners who wish to leverage the bandit paradigm for their application.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems (RS) commonly retrieve potential candidate items for users from a massive number of items by modeling user interests based on historical interactions. However, historical interaction data is highly sparse, and most items are long-tail items, which limits the representation learning for item discovery. This problem is further augmented by the discovery of novel or cold-start items. For example, after a user displays interest in bitcoin financial investment shows in the podcast space, a recommender system may want to suggest, e.g., a newly released blockchain episode from a more technical show. Episode correlations help the discovery, especially when interaction data of episodes is limited. Accordingly, we build upon the classical Two-Tower model and introduce the novel Multi-Source Augmentations using a Contrastive Learning framework (MSACL) to enhance episode embedding learning by incorporating positive episodes from numerous correlated semantics. Extensive experiments on a real-world podcast recommendation dataset from a large audio streaming platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for user podcast exploration and cold-start episode recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Calibration in recommender systems has recently gained significant attention. In the recommended list of items, calibration ensures that the various (past) areas of interest of a user are reflected with their corresponding proportions. For instance, if a user has watched, say, 80 romance movies and 20 action movies, then it is reasonable to expect the recommended list of movies to be comprised of about 80% romance and 20% action movies as well. Calibration is particularly important given that optimizing towards accuracy often leads to the user's minority interests being dominated by their main interests, or by a few overall popular items, in the recommendations they receive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the max flow problem for generating calibrated recommendations. In a series of experiments using two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art in generating relevant and calibrated recommendation lists.",

They can be found anywhere from e-commerce platforms (eBay, Amazon) to music or movie streaming (Spotify, Netflix), social media (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok), travel platforms (Booking.com, Expedia), and much more. Whether a recommendation is successful or not can rely on multiple objectives such as user satisfaction, business value, and societal issues. In addition, the long-term happiness (along with short-term excitements and delight) of the users is critical for a recommender system to be considered successful. MORS workshop brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss the importance of these aspects of recommender systems and find ways to develop algorithms to build multi-objective recommenders and also evaluation metrics to assess their success.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems are modulating what billions of people are exposed to on a daily basis. Typically, these systems are optimized for user engagement signals such as clicks, streams, likes, or a weighted combination of such sets. Despite the pervasiveness of this practice, little research has been done to explore the downstream impacts of optimization choice on users, creators and the ecosystem they are offered in. We used a platform that caters recommendations to millions of people and show in practice what you optimize for can have a large impact on the content users are exposed to, as well as what they end up consuming. In this work, we use podcast recommendations with two engagement signals: Subscription vs. Plays to show that the choice of user engagement matters. We deployed recommendation models optimized for each signal in production and observed that consumption outcomes substantially defer depending on the target used. Upon further investigation, we observed that users\u2019 patterns of podcast engagement depend on the type of podcast, and each podcast can cater to specific user goals & needs. Optimizing for streams can bias the recommendations towards certain podcast types, undermine users\u2019 aspirational interests and put some show categories at disadvantage. Finally, using calibration we demonstrate that informed balanced recommendations can help address this issue and thereby satisfy diverse user interests.",

            "title": "Sequential Recommendation via Stochastic Self-Attention",
            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation models the dynamics of a user\u2019s previous behaviors in order to forecast the next item, and has drawn a lot of attention. Transformer-based approaches, which embed items as vectors and use dot-product self-attention to measure the relationship between items, demonstrate superior capabilities among existing sequential methods. However, users\u2019 real-world sequential behaviors are uncertain rather than deterministic, posing a significant challenge to present techniques. We further suggest that dot-product-based approaches cannot fully capture collaborative transitivity, which can be derived in item-item transitions inside sequences and is beneficial for cold start items. We further argue that BPR loss has no constraint on positive and sampled negative items, which misleads the optimization. We propose a novel STOchastic Self-Attention (STOSA) to overcome these issues. STOSA, in particular, embeds each item as a stochastic Gaussian distribution, the covariance of which encodes the uncertainty. We devise a novel Wasserstein Self-Attention module to characterize item-item position-wise relationships in sequences, which effectively incorporates uncertainty into model training. Wasserstein attentions also enlighten the collaborative transitivity learning as it satisfies triangle inequality. Moreover, we introduce a novel regularization term to the ranking loss, which assures the dissimilarity between positive and the negative items. Extensive experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art baselines, especially on cold start items. The code is available in https://github.com/zfan20/STOSA.",

            "abstract": "Businesses often deploy recommenders to help users fulfil their needs and to provide a better user experience with their platform. However, they may also need to guide users towards a certain content depending on time, situation, and business needs. For example, giving a fair exposure opportunity to less popular items provides a healthier business model in which more suppliers can survive and thrive. In this work, we explore target-aware diversification as an approach to mitigate exposure bias in a calibrated way. Provided with a target ratio for each category\u2019s exposure, we balance this objective with the relevance of the recommended items through two main approaches: 1) diversification based only on the system\u2019s predefined target and 2) diversification based on system\u2019s target while taking into account the user\u2019s tolerance for diversity. We explore the effectiveness of our proposed models on a publicly available dataset. Experimental results show that our approach can systematically diversify the recommendations towards a pre-defined target while maintaining the relevance of the recommendations to a good extent. We also conclude that the trade-off between achieving the target and maintaining relevance has a close connection with the feasibility of the defined target given the previous users\u2019 consumption.",

            "abstract": "Historically, the main criterion for a successful recommender system was the relevance of the recommended items to the user. In other words, the only objective for the recommendation algorithm was to learn user\u2019s preferences for different items and generate recommendations accordingly. However, real-world recommender systems are well beyond a simple objective and often need to take into account multiple objectives simultaneously. These objectives can be either from the users\u2019 perspective or they could come from other stakeholders such as item providers or any party that could be impacted by the recommendations. Such multi-objective and multi-stakeholder recommenders present unique challenges and these challenges were the focus of the MORS workshop.",
