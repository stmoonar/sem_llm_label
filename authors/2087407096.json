            "title": "Travel Bird: A Personalized Destination Recommender with TourBERT and Airbnb Experiences",
            "abstract": "We present Travel Bird, a novel personalized destination recommendation and exploration interface which allows its users to find their next tourist destination by describing their specific preferences in a narrative form. Unlike other solutions, Travel Bird is based on TourBERT, a novel NLP model we developed, specifically tailored to the tourism domain. Travel Bird creates a two-dimensional personalized destination exploration space from TourBERT embeddings of social media content and the users' textual description of the experience they are looking for. In this demo, we will showcase several use cases for Travel Bird, which are beneficial for consumers and destination management organizations.",

            "abstract": "The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is currently one of the most important and state-of-the-art models for natural language. However, it has also been shown that for domain-specific tasks it is helpful to pretrain BERT on a domain-specific corpus. In this paper, we present TourBERT, a pretrained language model for tourism. We describe how TourBERT was developed and evaluated. The evaluations show that TourBERT is outperforming BERT in all tourism-specific tasks.",
