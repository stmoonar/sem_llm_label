            "abstract": "In this short position paper, we argue that there is a need for a unifying data model that can support popular graph formats such as RDF, RDF* and property graphs, while at the same time being powerful enough to naturally store information from complex knowledge graphs, such as Wikidata, without the need for a complex reification scheme. Our proposal, called the multilayer graph model, presents a simple and flexible data model for graphs that can naturally support all of the above, and more. We also observe that the idea of multilayer graphs has appeared in existing graph systems from different vendors and research groups, illustrating its versatility.",

            "abstract": "Information exploration tasks are inherently complex, ill-structured, and involve sequences of actions usually spread over many sessions. When exploring a dataset, users tend to experiment higher degrees of uncertainty, mostly raised by knowledge gaps concerning the information sources, the task, and the efficiency of the chosen exploration actions, strategies, and tools in supporting the task solution process. Provided these concerns, exploration tools should be designed with the goal of leveraging the mapping between user's cognitive actions and solution strategies onto the current systems' operations. However, state-of-the-art systems fail in providing an expressive set of operations that covers a wide range of exploration problems. There is not a common understanding of neither which operators are required nor in which ways they can be used by explorers. In order to mitigate these shortcomings, this work presents a formal framework of exploration operations expressive enough to describe at least the majority of state-of-the-art exploration interfaces and tasks. We also show how the framework leveraged a new evaluation approach, where we draw precise comparisons between tools concerning the range of exploration tasks they support.",

A simple example illustrating how this could be done is given, related to claims about fraud in the US 2020 Presidential elections.",

Ontologies have shown themselves to be increasingly promising, adding semantics and standardizing the different terms used in a domain. Thereby, our framework seeks to explain and make explicit the tuning heuristics reasoning while enabling the evaluation of new ontology-inferred methods. In this paper we focus on the main aspects of the Outer-Tuning component-based architecture. We also give an overview of our tool in practice. Finally, we show two useful extensions, concerning new DBMSs and a way of dockerizing into a container.\n\n\n",

            "abstract": "Wikidata and Wikipedia have been proven useful for reason-ing in natural language applications, like question answering or entitylinking. Yet, no existing work has studied the potential of Wikidata for commonsense reasoning. This paper investigates whether Wikidata con-tains commonsense knowledge which is complementary to existing commonsense sources. Starting from a definition of common sense, we devise three guiding principles, and apply them to generate a commonsense subgraph of Wikidata (Wikidata-CS). Within our approach, we map the relations of Wikidata to ConceptNet, which we also leverage to integrate Wikidata-CS into an existing consolidated commonsense graph. Our experiments reveal that: 1) albeit Wikidata-CS represents a small portion of Wikidata, it is an indicator that Wikidata contains relevant commonsense knowledge, which can be mapped to 15 ConceptNet relations; 2) the overlap between Wikidata-CS and other commonsense sources is low, motivating the value of knowledge integration; 3) Wikidata-CS has been evolving over time at a slightly slower rate compared to the overall Wikidata, indicating a possible lack of focus on commonsense knowledge. Based on these findings, we propose three recommended actions to improve the coverage and quality of Wikidata-CS further.",

However, current solutions are not easily scalable, especially when it comes to the addition of new targeted people. We propose a cluster-matching-based approach for face recognition in video. In our approach, we use unsupervised learning to cluster the faces present in both the dataset and targeted videos selected for face recognition. Moreover, we design a cluster matching heuristic to associate clusters in both sets that is also capable of identifying when a face belongs to a non-registered person. Our method has achieved a recall of 99.435% and a precision of 99.131% in the task of video face recognition. Besides performing face recognition, it can also be used to determine the video segments where each person is present.",
