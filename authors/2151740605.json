            "abstract": "Powered by advanced information industry and intelligent technology, more and more complex systems are exhibiting characteristics of the cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). And human factors have become crucial in the operations of complex social systems. Traditional mechanical analysis and social simulations alone are powerless for analyzing complex social systems. Against this backdrop, computational experiments have emerged as a new method for quantitative analysis of complex social systems by combining social simulation (e.g., ABM), complexity science, and domain knowledge. However, in the process of applying computational experiments, the construction of experiment system not only considers a large number of artificial society models, but also involves a large amount of data and knowledge. As a result, how to integrate various data, model and knowledge to achieve a running experiment system has become a key challenge. This paper proposes an integrated design framework of computational experiment system, which is composed of four parts: generation of digital subject, generation of digital object, design of operation engine, and construction of experiment system. Finally, this paper outlines a typical case study of coal mine emergency management to verify the validity of the proposed framework.",

            "abstract": "Powered by advanced information technology, more and more complex systems are exhibiting characteristics of the cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). In this context, computational experiments method has emerged as a novel approach for the design, analysis, management, control, and integration of CPSS, which can realize the causal analysis of complex systems by means of \u201calgorithmization\u201d of \u201ccounterfactuals\u201d. However, because CPSS involve human and social factors (e.g., autonomy, initiative, and sociality), it is difficult for traditional design of experiment (DOE) methods to achieve the generative explanation of system emergence. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an integrated approach to the design of computational experiments, incorporating three key modules: 1) Descriptive module: Determining the influencing factors and response variables of the system by means of the modeling of an artificial society; 2) Interpretative module: Selecting factorial experimental design solution to identify the relationship between influencing factors and macro phenomena; 3) Predictive module: Building a meta-model that is equivalent to artificial society to explore its operating laws. Finally, a case study of crowd-sourcing platforms is presented to illustrate the application process and effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can reveal the social impact of algorithmic behavior on \u201crider race\u201d.",

In consideration of the cost, legal, and institutional constraints on the study of CPSS in real world, computational experiments have emerged as a new method for quantitative analysis of CPSS. However, with the increase of application scenarios, how to map complex and diverse domain models to artificial society models has become a key challenge to hinder the wide use of computational experiments. In this article, the docking framework between the domain model and the artificial society model was proposed in this article, and the model docking specification is given from three aspects: the agent model, the environmental model, and the rules model. In addition, the effectiveness of the framework was verified by two classic cases: artificial stock market and epidemic prevention and control. The result showed that the proposed model docking framework can provide technical support for the multidisciplinary applications of computational experiments and significantly reduce the difficulty of using the method.",

Specifically, we review the achievements of Sora, picture the perspectives of artificiofactual experiments on intelligent vehicles based on the performance of Sora-type techniques, and discuss how far are we now.",
