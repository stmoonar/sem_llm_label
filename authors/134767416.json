Therefore, this work presents a real-time Internet of things (IoT) software architecture to automatically calculate and visualize a COVID-19 aerosol transmission risk estimation. This risk estimation is based on indoor climate sensor data, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature, which is fed into Streaming MASSIF, a semantic stream processing platform, to perform the computations. The results are visualized on a dynamic dashboard that automatically suggests appropriate visualizations based on the semantics of the data. To evaluate the complete architecture, the indoor climate during the student examination periods of January 2020 (pre-COVID) and January 2021 (mid-COVID) was analyzed. When compared to each other, we observe that the COVID-19 measures in 2021 resulted in a safer indoor environment.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, neural networks are viewed from the perspective of connected neuron layers represented as matrix multiplications. We propose to compose these weight matrices from a set of orthogonal basis matrices by approaching them as elements of the real matrices vector space under addition and multiplication. Making use of the Kronecker product for vectors, this composition is unified with the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the weight matrix. The orthogonal components of this SVD are trained with a descent curve on the Stiefel manifold using the Cayley transform. Next, update equations for the singular values and initialization routines are derived. Finally, acceleration for stochastic gradient descent optimization using this formulation is discussed. Our proposed method allows more parameter-efficient representations of weight matrices in neural networks. These decomposed weight matrices achieve maximal performance in both standard and more complicated neural architectures. Furthermore, the more parameter-efficient decomposed layers are shown to be less dependent on optimization and better conditioned. As a tradeoff, training time is increased up to a factor of 2. These observations are consequently attributed to the properties of the method and choice of optimization over the manifold of orthogonal matrices.",

            "abstract": "Solenoid valves are critical components in many process control systems, as their failure is often a root cause for plant shutdowns. Therefore, the ability to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of solenoid valves is highly desirable. In this paper, a novel data-driven RUL prediction methodology for solenoid valves is proposed, by training deep neural networks on images constructed from raw current signatures. The performance is compared to shallow machine learning algorithms, trained on features which are obtained using domain expertise on the valves. We show that an ensemble of CNN subnetworks (constructed by the AdaNet algorithm) achieves a predictive performance comparable to the feature-based approaches (p = 0.584 for linear regression, p = 0.321 for Gradient Boosted Regression Trees). By focusing on reducing the modeling effort required for constructing features and fixing neural network architectures, this study offers a new and promising approach for solenoid valve prognostics, and thus even more complex systems in the future.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic models of mechatronic systems are abundantly used in the context of motion control and design of complex servo applications. In practice, these systems are often plagued by unknown interactions, which make the physics-based relations of the system dynamics only partially known. This article presents a neural network augmented physics (NNAP) model as a combination of physics-inspired and neural layers. The neural layers are inserted in the model to compensate for the unmodeled interactions, without requiring direct measurements of these unknown phenomena. In contrast to traditional approaches, both the neural network and physical parameters are simultaneously optimized, solely by using state and control input measurements. The methodology is applied on experimental data of a slider\u2013crank setup, for which the state-dependent load interactions are unknown. The NNAP model proves to be a stable and accurate modeling formalism for dynamic systems that ab initio can only be partially described by physical laws. Moreover, the results show that a recurrent implementation of the NNAP model enables improved robustness and accuracy of the system state predictions, compared to its feedforward counterpart. Besides capturing the system dynamics, the NNAP model provides a means to gain new insights by extracting the neural network from the converged NNAP model. In this way, we discovered accurate representations of the unknown spring force interaction and friction phenomena acting on the slider mechanism.",

            "abstract": "In order to minimize operation and maintenance costs and extend the lifetime of rotating machinery, damaging conditions and faults should be detected early and automatically. To enable this, sensor streams should continuously be monitored, processed, and interpreted. In recent years, infrared thermal imaging has gained attention for the said purpose. However, the detection capabilities of a system that uses infrared thermal imaging is limited by the modality captured by this single sensor, as is any single sensor-based system. Hence, within this paper a multisensor system is proposed that not only uses infrared thermal imaging data, but also vibration measurements for automatic condition and fault detection in rotating machinery. It is shown that by combining these two types of sensor data, several conditions/faults and combinations can be detected more accurately than when considering the sensor streams individually.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Spectral pixel classification is one of the principal techniques used in hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis. In this article, we propose an unsupervised feature learning method for classification of hyperspectral images. The proposed method learns a dictionary of sub-feature basis representations from the spectral domain, which allows effective use of the correlated spectral data. The learned dictionary is then used in encoding convolutional samples from the hyperspectral input pixels to an expanded but sparse feature space. Expanded hyperspectral feature representations enable linear separation between object classes present in an image. To evaluate the proposed method, we performed experiments on several commonly used HSI data sets acquired at different locations and by different sensors. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other pixel-wise classification methods that make use of unsupervised feature extraction approaches. Additionally, even though our approach does not use any prior knowledge, or labelled training data to learn features, it yields either advantageous, or comparable, results in terms of classification accuracy with respect to recent semi-supervised methods.",

We evaluated the solution by building a smart Kinect sensor that is able to dynamically switch between IR and RGB and optimizing person detection by incorporating feedback from pressure sensors, as such demonstrating the collaboration among sensors to enhance detection of complex events.
