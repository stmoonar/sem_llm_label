            "abstract": "Network alignment is the task of identifying topologically and semantically similar nodes across (two) different networks. It plays an important role in various applications ranging from social network analysis to bioinformatic network interactions. However, existing alignment models either cannot handle large-scale graphs or fail to leverage different types of network information or modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end alignment framework that can leverage different modalities to compare and align network nodes in an efficient way. In order to exploit the richness of the network context, our model constructs multiple embeddings for each node, each of which captures one modality or type of network information. We then design a late-fusion mechanism to combine the learned embeddings based on the importance of the underlying information. Our fusion mechanism allows our model to be adapted to various types of structure of the input network. Experimental results show that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy on real and synthetic datasets, while being robust against various noise factors.",

            "abstract": "Protein structure prediction (PSP) is a vital challenge in bioinformatics, structural biology and drug discovery. Protein secondary structure (SS) prediction is critical since three-dimensional (3D) structures are primarily made up of secondary structures. With the advancement of deep learning approaches, SS classification accuracy has been significantly improved. Many existing methods use an ensemble of complex neural networks to improve SS prediction. Because of the high dimensionality of the hyperparameter space, deep neural networks with complex architectures are typically challenging to train effectively. Also, predicting secondary structures in the boundary regions between different types of SS is challenging. This study presents Multi-S3P, which employs bidirectional Long-Short-Term-Memory (BILSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a self-attention mechanism to improve the secondary structure prediction using an effective training strategy to capture the unique characteristics of each type of secondary structure and combine them more effectively. The ensemble of CNN and BILSTM can learn both contextual information and long-range interactions between the residues. In addition, using a self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on the most important features for improving performance. We used the SPOT-1D dataset for the training and validation of our model using a set of four input features derived from amino acid sequences. Further, the model was tested on four popular independent test datasets and compared with various state-of-the-art predictors. The presented results show that Multi-S3P outperformed the other methods in terms of Q3, Q8 accuracy and other performance metrics, achieving the highest Q3 accuracy of 87.57% and a Q8 accuracy of 77.56% on the TEST2016 test set. More importantly, Multi-S3P demonstrates high performance in SS boundary regions. Our experiment also demonstrates that the combination of different input features and a multi-network-based training strategy significantly improved the performance.",

This work extends such a logical framework by considering the deontic aspect. The resulting logic will not just be able to model policies but also tackle well-known aspects that occur in numerous legal systems. The use of Defeasible Logic (DL) to model meta-rules in the application area we just alluded to has been investigated. Within this line of research, the study mentioned above was not focusing on the general computational properties of meta-rules. This study fills this gap with two major contributions. First, we introduce and formalise two variants of Defeasible Deontic Logic with Meta-Rules to represent (1) defeasible meta-theories with deontic modalities, and (2) two different types of conflicts among rules: Simple Conflict Defeasible Deontic Logic, and Cautious Conflict Defeasible Deontic Logic. Second, we advance efficient algorithms to compute the extensions for both variants.",

            "abstract": "Interlocking Institutional Worlds (IWs) is a concept explaining the need to interoperate between institutions (or players), to solve problems of common interest in a given domain. Managing knowledge in the IWs domain is complex; however, promoting knowledge sharing based on standards and common terms agreeable to all players is essential and is something that must be established. In this context, ontologies, as a conceptual tool and a key component of knowledge-based systems, have been used by organizations for effective knowledge management, better decision-making, and interoperability among diverse institutions of an IWs domain. The development of ontology involves structural and logical complexity, and requires a well-designed, mature, and widely accepted methodology, to ensure its reliability. Many methodologies for ontology development have been proposed by several researchers; however, most of the developed methodologies have not included several important phases. Furthermore, several methodologies have not provided the complete details of the techniques and activities involved in the ontology construction process. Fewer details make it difficult to follow a methodology for designing ontologies. This study aims to compare existing methodologies based on sixteen important criteria and proposes an improved methodology for ontology development for IWs domains. The proposed methodology has included several important phases such as the Estimation of Human Resources, Re-engineering and Re-using of Resources, Collaborative Ontology Construction, the Conceptualization of both Endurants and Perdurants, Localization of an Ontology, Ontology Integration and Merging, Support for Interoperability, Versioning of an Ontology, and Ontology Population. The proposed methodology has been applied to design an OntoWM domain ontology for the Waste Management (WM) domain. The evaluation of the proposed methodology has been made by utilizing the designed OntoWM domain ontology in an ontology-based web application called SmartBinAnalytics. SmartBinAnalytics has been built using OntoWM, Java Server Pages (JSP), Jena Application Programming Interface (API), and MySQL. The proposed methodology can be used for the construction of domain ontologies in any IWs domain.",

            "abstract": "Toxicity prediction of chemical compounds is a grand challenge. Lately, it achieved significant progress in accuracy but using a huge set of features, implementing a complex blackbox technique such as a deep neural network, and exploiting enormous computational resources. In this paper, we strongly argue for the models and methods that are simple in machine learning characteristics, efficient in computing resource usage, and powerful to achieve very high accuracy levels. To demonstrate this, we develop a single task-based chemical toxicity prediction framework using only 2D features that are less compute intensive. We effectively use a decision tree to obtain an optimum number of features from a collection of thousands of them. We use a shallow neural network and jointly optimize it with decision tree taking both network parameters and input features into account. Our model needs only a minute on a single CPU for its training while existing methods using deep neural networks need about 10 min on NVidia Tesla K40 GPU. However, we obtain similar or better performance on several toxicity benchmark tasks. We also develop a cumulative feature ranking method which enables us to identify features that can help chemists perform prescreening of toxic compounds effectively.",

            "abstract": "\n Dropout has been proven to be an effective technique for regularizing and preventing the co-adaptation of neurons in deep neural networks (DNN). It randomly drops units with a probability of p during the training stage of DNN to avoid overfitting. The working mechanism of dropout can be interpreted as approximately and exponentially combining many different neural network architectures efficiently, leading to a powerful ensemble. In this work, we propose a novel diversification strategy for dropout, which aims at generating more different neural network architectures in less numbers of iterations. The dropped units in the last forward propagation will be marked. Then the selected units for dropping in the current forward propagation will be retained if they have been marked in the last forward propagation, i.e., we only mark the units from the last forward propagation. We call this new regularization scheme Tabu dropout, whose significance lies in that it does not have extra parameters compared with the standard dropout strategy and is computationally efficient as well. Experiments conducted on four public datasets show that Tabu dropout improves the performance of the standard dropout, yielding better generalization capability.",

            "abstract": "The term \"interpretability\" is oftenly used by machine learning researchers each with their own intuitive understanding of it. There is no universal well agreed upon definition of interpretability in machine learning. As any type of science discipline is mainly driven by the set of formulated questions rather than by different tools in that discipline, e.g. astrophysics is the discipline that learns the composition of stars, not as the discipline that use the spectroscopes. Similarly, we propose that machine learning interpretability should be a discipline that answers specific questions related to interpretability. These questions can be of statistical, causal and counterfactual nature. Therefore, there is a need to look into the interpretability problem of machine learning in the context of questions that need to be addressed rather than different tools. We discuss about a hypothetical interpretability framework driven by a question based scientific approach rather than some specific machine learning model. Using a question based notion of interpretability, we can step towards understanding the science of machine learning rather than its engineering. This notion will also help us understanding any specific problem more in depth rather than relying solely on machine learning methods.",

We propose a computational model for makespan minimisation of the new PFSP variant and show that the time complexity is NP Hard. We then develop a constraint-guided local search algorithm that uses a new intensifying restart technique along with variable neighbourhood descent and greedy selection. The experimental study indicates that the proposed algorithm, on a set of wellknown benchmark instances, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art search algorithms for PFSP.\n \n",

In the Platform of Smart Phone, few of TTS systems are available for Bangla Language. Nowadays android is a popular platform considering Smartphone. There are few Bangla TTS Systems are Available with different kind of Mechanisms and techniques, various kind of tools were used. Here we tried to introduce all mechanisms together and proving a summary above all existing system.",
