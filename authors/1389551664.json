            "title": "Efficient Exploration of the Rashomon Set of Rule Set Models",
            "abstract": "Today, as increasingly complex predictive models are developed, simple rule sets remain a crucial tool to obtain interpretable predictions and drive high-stakes decision making. However, a single rule set provides a partial representation of a learning task. An emerging paradigm in interpretable machine learning aims at exploring the Rashomon set of all models exhibiting near-optimal performance. Existing work on Rashomon-set exploration focuses on exhaustive search of the Rashomon set for particular classes of models, which can be a computationally challenging task. On the other hand, exhaustive enumeration leads to redundancy that often is not necessary, and a representative sample or an estimate of the size of the Rashomon set is sufficient for many applications. In this work, we propose, for the first time, efficient methods to explore the Rashomon set of rule set models with or without exhaustive search. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in a variety of scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Can we get speech recognition tools to work on limited-memory devices? The Viterbi algorithm is a classic dynamic programming (DP) solution used to find the most likely sequence of hidden states in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). While the algorithm finds universal application ranging from communication systems to speech recognition to bioinformatics, its scalability has been scarcely addressed, stranding it to a space complexity that grows with the number of observations. In this paper, we propose SIEVE (Space Efficient Viterbi), a reformulation of the Viterbi algorithm that eliminates its space-complexity dependence on the number of observations to be explained. SIEVE discards and recomputes parts of the DP solution for the sake of space efficiency, in divide-and-conquer fashion, without incurring a time-complexity overhead. Our thorough experimental evaluation shows that SIEVE is highly effective in reducing the memory usage compared to the classic Viterbi algorithm, while avoiding the runtime overhead of a na\u00efve space-efficient solution.",

            "abstract": "Bayesian networks are general, well-studied probabilistic models that capture dependencies among a set of variables. Variable Elimination is a fundamental algorithm for probabilistic inference over Bayesian networks. In this paper, we propose a novel materialization method, which can lead to significant efficiency gains when processing inference queries using the Variable Elimination algorithm. In particular, we address the problem of choosing a set of intermediate results to precompute and materialize, so as to maximize the expected efficiency gain over a given query workload. For the problem we consider, we provide an optimal polynomial-time algorithm and discuss alternative methods. We validate our technique using real-world Bayesian networks. Our experimental results confirm that a modest amount of materialization can lead to significant improvements in the running time of queries, with an average gain of 70%, and reaching up to a gain of 99%, for a uniform workload of queries. Moreover, in comparison with existing junction tree methods that also rely on materialization, our approach achieves competitive efficiency during inference using significantly lighter materialization.",

            "abstract": "Bayesian networks are popular probabilistic models that capture the conditional dependencies among a set of variables. Inference in Bayesian networks is a fundamental task for answering probabilistic queries over a subset of variables in the data. However, exact inference in Bayesian networks is \\NP-hard, which has prompted the development of many practical inference methods. In this paper, we focus on improving the performance of the junction-tree algorithm, a well-known method for exact inference in Bayesian networks. In particular, we seek to leverage information in the workload of probabilistic queries to obtain an optimal workload-aware materialization of junction trees, with the aim to accelerate the processing of inference queries. We devise an optimal pseudo-polynomial algorithm to tackle this problem and discuss approximation schemes. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches for efficient processing of inference queries via junction trees, our methods are the first to exploit the information provided in query workloads. Our experimentation on several real-world Bayesian networks confirms the effectiveness of our techniques in speeding-up query processing.",

            "title": "Span-core Decomposition for Temporal Networks",
            "abstract": "When analyzing temporal networks, a fundamental task is the identification of dense structures (i.e., groups of vertices that exhibit a large number of links), together with their temporal span (i.e., the period of time for which the high density holds). In this article, we tackle this task by introducing a notion of temporal core decomposition where each core is associated with two quantities, its coreness, which quantifies how densely it is connected, and its span, which is a temporal interval: we call such cores span-cores. For a temporal network defined on a discrete temporal domain T, the total number of time intervals included in T is quadratic in |T|, so that the total number of span-cores is potentially quadratic in |T| as well. Our first main contribution is an algorithm that, by exploiting containment properties among span-cores, computes all the span-cores efficiently. Then, we focus on the problem of finding only the maximal span-cores, i.e., span-cores that are not dominated by any other span-core by both their coreness property and their span. We devise a very efficient algorithm that exploits theoretical findings on the maximality condition to directly extract the maximal ones without computing all span-cores. Finally, as a third contribution, we introduce the problem of temporal community search, where a set of query vertices is given as input, and the goal is to find a set of densely-connected subgraphs containing the query vertices and covering the whole underlying temporal domain T. We derive a connection between this problem and the problem of finding (maximal) span-cores. Based on this connection, we show how temporal community search can be solved in polynomial-time via dynamic programming, and how the maximal span-cores can be profitably exploited to significantly speed-up the basic algorithm. We provide an extensive experimentation on several real-world temporal networks of widely different origins and characteristics. Our results confirm the efficiency and scalability of the proposed methods. Moreover, we showcase the practical relevance of our techniques in a number of applications on temporal networks, describing face-to-face contacts between individuals in schools. Our experiments highlight the relevance of the notion of (maximal) span-core in analyzing social dynamics, detecting/correcting anomalies in the data, and graph-embedding-based network classification.",
