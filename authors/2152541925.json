            "title": "A Counterfactual Collaborative Session-based Recommender System",
            "abstract": "Most session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) focus on extracting information from the observed items in the current session of a user to predict a next item, ignoring the causes outside the session (called outer-session causes, OSCs) that influence the user\u2019s selection of items. However, these causes widely exist in the real world, and few studies have investigated their role in SBRSs. In this work, we analyze the causalities and correlations of the OSCs in SBRSs from the perspective of causal inference. We find that the OSCs are essentially the confounders in SBRSs, which leads to spurious correlations in the data used to train SBRS models. To address this problem, we propose a novel SBRS framework named COCO-SBRS (COunterfactual COllaborative Session-Based Recommender Systems) to learn the causality between OSCs and user-item interactions in SBRSs. COCO-SBRS first adopts a self-supervised approach to pre-train a recommendation model by designing pseudo-labels of causes for each user\u2019s selection of the item in data to guide the training process. Next, COCO-SBRS adopts counterfactual inference to recommend items based on the outputs of the pre-trained recommendation model considering the causalities to alleviate the data sparsity problem. As a result, COCO-SBRS can learn the causalities in data, preventing the model from learning spurious correlations. The experimental results of our extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over ten representative SBRSs.",

            "abstract": "Users\u2019 purchase behaviors are complex and dynamic, which are usually driven by various personal demands evolving with time. According to psychology and economic theories, user demands can be satisfied with a sequence of purchase behaviors, resulting in a basket of items. However, most of the existing works simply predict the next basket from a shallow perspective of (purchase) sequence data modeling without deep insight into the underlying factors which drive user purchase behaviors. In fact, filling a basket with multiple items is a process to incrementally satisfy a user's demand. Therefore, the key challenges to predict a user's next basket lie in (1) how to track the changes of the user's demand, and (2) how to satisfy her demand at a given moment. To this end, we propose an Evolving DEmand SAtisfaction (EvoDESA) model to model a user's demand evolution for next-basket prediction. In EvoDESA, a demand evolution module learns the dynamics of user demand over a sequence of basket-purchase behaviors. Then, a next-basket planning module effectively packs an optimal combination of items to best satisfy the user's current demand. Extensive experiments on three real-world transaction datasets demonstrate the considerable superiority of EvoDESA over the state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": "The sparse interactions between users and items on the web have aggravated the difficulty of their representations in recommender systems. Existing approaches leverage item attributes (e.g., item categories and tags) to alleviate the data sparsity problem, so as to enhance the performance and interpretability of recommendation. However, directly using all attributes of items cannot avoid the negative impacts of low-quality attributes, where manually labeling the quality of attributes is time-consuming. To this end, we propose HQRec to jointly measure the quality of attributes automatically and perform recommendation accurately. Specifically, we first analyze the different qualities among item attributes, and propose to leverage item categories to select high-quality tags via category-guided quality measurement and direction-aware optimization in an unsupervised fashion. Then, we propose to capture the complex relations among users and items based on the high-quality attributes, where a novel quality-aware embedding fusion and quality-aware embedding propagation mechanism for users and items is devised. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets show drastic performance gains brought by our proposed HQRec framework, which constantly achieves an average of 14.73% improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of Recall and NDCG metrics. Insightful case studies also show that our automatic quality measurements are highly accurate and interpretable.",

            "abstract": "Automatic tumor or lesion segmentation is a crucial step in medical image analysis for computer-aided diagnosis. Although the existing methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art performance, many challenges still remain in medical tumor segmentation. This is because, although the human visual system can detect symmetries in 2-D images effectively, regular CNNs can only exploit translation invariance, overlooking further inherent symmetries existing in medical images, such as rotations and reflections. To solve this problem, we propose a novel group equivariant segmentation framework by encoding those inherent symmetries for learning more precise representations. First, kernel-based equivariant operations are devised on each orientation, which allows it to effectively address the gaps of learning symmetries in existing approaches. Then, to keep segmentation networks globally equivariant, we design distinctive group layers with layer-wise symmetry constraints. Finally, based on our novel framework, extensive experiments conducted on real-world clinical data demonstrate that a group equivariant Res-UNet (called GER-UNet) outperforms its regular CNN-based counterpart and the state-of-the-art segmentation methods in the tasks of hepatic tumor segmentation, COVID-19 lung infection segmentation, and retinal vessel detection. More importantly, the newly built GER-UNet also shows potential in reducing the sample complexity and the redundancy of filters, upgrading current segmentation CNNs, and delineating organs on other medical imaging modalities.",

            "abstract": "With the advancement of data science and AI, more and more powerful and accurate recommender systems (RSs) have been developed. They provide recommendation services in various areas, including shopping, eating, travelling and entertainment. RSs have achieved a great success and benefted the society. However, most of the research on RS has focused on the improvement of the recommendation accuracy, while ignoring other important qualities, such as trustworthiness (robustness, fairness, explainability, privacy and security) and social impact (influence on users' recognition and behaviours) of the recommendations. These are important aspects and cannot be overlooked since they measure properties that determine whether the recommendation service is reliable, trustworthy and benefcial to individual users and society. In this work, responsible recommendations refer to trustworthy recommendation techniques and positive-social-impact recommendation results. This workshop aims to engage with active researchers from the RS community, and other communities, as social science, to discuss state-of-the-art research results related to the core challenges of responsible recommendation services. We will focus on two main topics of responsible RSs: (1) developing reliable and trustworthy RS models and algorithms, to provide reliable recommendation results when facing a complex, uncertain and dynamic scenario; (2) assessing the social influence of RSs on human's recognition and behaviours and ensuring the influence is positive to the society.",

            "abstract": "Despite the tremendous efforts by social media platforms and fact-check services for fake news detection, fake news and misinformation still spread wildly on social media platforms (e.g., Twitter). Consequently, fake news mitigation strategies are urgently needed. Most of the existing work on fake news mitigation focuses on the overall mitigation on a whole social network while ignoring developing concrete mitigation strategies to deter individual users from sharing fake news. In this paper, we propose a novel veracity-aware and event-driven recommendation model to recommend personalised corrective true news to individual users for effectively debunking fake news. Our proposed model Rec4Mit (Recommendation for Mitigation) not only effectively captures a user\u2019s current reading preference with a focus on which event, e.g., US election, from her/his recent reading history containing true and/or fake news, but also accurately predicts the veracity (true or fake) of candidate news. As a result, Rec4Mit can recommend the most suitable true news to best match the user\u2019s preference as well as to mitigate fake news. In particular, for those users who have read fake news of a certain event, Rec4Mit is able to recommend the corresponding true news of the same event. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show Rec4Mit significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art news recommendation methods in terms of the capability to recommend personalized true news for fake news mitigation.",

            "abstract": "Implicit feedback is widely used in collaborative filtering methods for sequential recommendation. It is well known that implicit feedback contains a large number of values that are missing not at random (MNAR); and the missing data is a mixture of negative and unknown feedback, making it difficult to learn users\u2019 negative preferences. Recent studies modeled exposure, a latent missingness variable which indicates whether an item is exposed to a user, to give each missing entry a confidence of being negative feedback. However, these studies use static models and ignore the information in temporal dependencies among items, which seems to be an essential underlying factor to subsequent missingness. To model and exploit the dynamics of missingness, we propose a latent variable named \u201cuser intent \u201d to govern the temporal changes of item missingness, and a hidden Markov model to represent such a process. The resulting framework captures the dynamic item missingness and incorporates it into matrix factorization (MF) for recommendation. We further extend the proposed framework to capture the dynamic preference of users, which results in a unified framework that is able to model different evolution patterns of user intent and user preference. We also explore two types of constraints to achieve a more compact and interpretable representation of user intents. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art recommender systems.",

            "abstract": "Virtual network embedding (VNE) can effectively deploy virtual networks (VNs) onto shared substrate network (SN) resources. However, with the consistent changing scalability and diversity demands of VNs, traditional VNE methods prove to be a challenging task for current cloud service platforms. Thus, we model a repeatable multi-dimensional virtual network embedding (RMD-VNE) problem for implementing multi-dimensional virtual networks (MD-VNs) that involves real servers, virtual machines, containers, and network simulators. The MD-VN is preprocessed and embedded via a heuristic method denoted as ReMiDvne. Following its transformation for the containers and simulation networks, the MD-VN topology undergoes a process of coarsening, partitioning, and uncoarsening. ReMiDvne then applies a topology-aware repeatable embedding solution to complete the embedding stage. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMiDvne outperforms seven baseline approaches through small-, 1,000- and 10,000-scale VNE simulation experiments. Remarkably, ReMiDvne improves the average rates of acceptance ratio, revenue, and revenue-cost ratio by up to 40.45, 40.45, and 299.03 percent, respectively, and reduces the average rate of cost by up to 64.16 percent. Furthermore, real-world VNE experiments are conducted based on the OpenStack platform. The results reveal the ability of ReMiDvne to efficiently reduce communication costs by up to 45.93 and 63.43 percent for download and upload, respectively.",

            "abstract": "CVaR-sensitive online portfolio selection (CS-OLPS) becomes increasingly important for investors because of its effectiveness to minimize conditional value at risk (CVaR) and control extreme losses. However, the non-stationary nature of financial markets makes it very difficult to address the CS-OLPS problem effectively. To address the CS-OLPS problem in non-stationary markets, we propose an effective news-driven method, named CAND, which adaptively exploits news to determine the adjustment tendency and adjustment scale for tracking the dynamic optimal portfolio with minimal CVaR in each trading round. In addition, we devise a filtering mechanism to reduce the errors caused by the noisy news for further improving CAND's effectiveness. We rigorously prove a sub-linear regret of CAND. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate CAND\u2019s superiority over the state-of-the-art portfolio methods in terms of returns and risks.",

            "abstract": "To address the long-standing data sparsity problem in recommender systems (RSs), cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been proposed to leverage the relatively richer information from a richer domain to improve the recommendation performance in a sparser domain. Although CDR has been extensively studied in recent years, there is a lack of a systematic review of the existing CDR approaches. To fill this gap, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing CDR approaches, including challenges, research progress, and prospects. Specifically, we first summarize existing CDR approaches into four types, including single-target CDR, single-target multi-domain recommendation (MDR), dual-target CDR, and multi-target CDR. We then present the definitions and challenges of these CDR approaches. Next, we propose a full-view categorization and new taxonomies on these approaches and report their research progress in detail. In the end, we share several promising prospects in CDR.",
