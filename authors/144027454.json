            "abstract": ". Research Objects (ROs) are becoming a popular means to capture the context and research artefacts associated with a research investigation in both human-readable and machine-readable formats. However, it is unclear how well ROs themselves adhere to the FAIR (find-able, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles. In this work, we describe a comprehensive analysis of the FAIR assessment of more than 2500 ROs across multiple disciplines. Our work integrates FAIROs, our existing RO evaluation service, in the ROHub platform. We discuss the challenges of calculating the FAIR assessment of aggregations of resources, and how we supplement the FAIROs tests with information from the RO-Crate descriptor file generated by ROHub.",

In this paper, we present the results regarding the implementation and deployment of the Polish decision support system (DSS) for integrated plant protection, as part of the large scale national project called eDwin. At the core of the DSS is an IoT network of agro-meteorological stations deployed across the whole Poland. Additionally, the DSS leverages a set of automatic phenological observation stations that are deployed in selected experimental fields. After the deployment and validation of several pest prediction models, the DSS currently allows Polish farmers and advisors to access and use 20 models related to the main cultivations in Poland. Moreover, a digital platform for the farmers and advisors has been designed and developed, providing four e-services, complemented with interoperable mechanisms and APIs.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture as a whole consists of many sectors reliant on each other for proper functioning. The need for cross sector cooperation is especially important between apiary owners and farmers. Indeed, it provides benefits for both: increasing and diversifying access to appropriate flowering plants on one hand and providing means of increasing pollination of plants and in turn yield from fields on the other. On the contrary, lack of information may result in poisoning beehive families operating near regions where specific plant protection products have been used. However, even although IT and IoT solutions are increasingly prevalent in agri-food sectors, there is still a significant barrier in connecting various systems, exchanging data and helping users in facilitating modern solutions. In this paper we present a viable solution to this problem by leveraging DEMETER platform and show it\u2019s usage to enable interoperability between commercial IoT beekeeper solution and emerging national farm management (eDWIN) and advisory tools.",

            "abstract": "There is an increasing tension in agriculture between the requirements to assure full safety on the one hand and keep costs under control on the other hand, both with respect to (inter)national strategies. Farmers need to measure and understand the impact of huge amount and variety of data which drive overall quality and yield in their fields. Among others, those are local weather data, Global Navigation System of Systems data, orthophotos and satellite imagery, data on soil specifics etc. A strong need to secure Big Data arises due to various repositories and heterogeneous sources. Data storage and visualisation requirements are in some cases competing as they are a common interest as well as a threat that helps one part of a value chain to gain a higher profit. As demonstrated in this paper, handling (Big) data is therefore a sensitive topic, where trust of producers on data security is essential.",

            "abstract": "Data-intensive science disciplines, like Earth Science, are increasingly producing and consuming a variety of digital resources during the course of a scientific investigation. Instead of having these resources in isolated repositories, scientists are seeking ways for managing and making these resources available from a single place, and at the same time they are also increasingly interested in the adoption of FAIR principles to enhance the visibility and reusability of scientific results. This has called for new methods to improve the access and communication of results. Research Objects are a key building block towards realising this vision. They provide a structured way (a model) to describe scientific resources related to an investigation, along with the context in which they were used and the people involved. But research objects are as useful in practice as the availability of tools supporting their adoption. In this paper, we present a toolkit, tailored for Earth Sciences, comprising a set of services and applications around research objects that support scientists throughout the research lifecycle to manage, share, find and reuse scientific results, and we discuss initial insights into the community adoption.",

In this setting, there is a growing need from earth scientists to collect and manage effectively these resources, including the data used, the methods applied, and the results produced. This is even more challenging if we consider i) the dynamic and collaborative nature of the earth science processes; ii) the interfaces typically used by scientists where they should be able to accomplish core management tasks with a minimal overhead. In this poster, we present our approach to address these challenges, which is based on research objects and on the associated technological support provided by ROHub platform.

            "abstract": "A research object is a single information unit encapsulating all the knowledge relevant to a particular scientific investigation, their associated metadata and the context where such resources were produced and came into play. Aimed at enhancing the preservation, reuse and scholarly communication of data-intensive science, research objects are both technical and social artifacts that represent a partnership between scientific communities and the computational support required in nowadays science. In this paper, we explore such partnership, identifying the lack of appropriate machine-readable metadata as one of its main inhibitors, and address the semantic enrichment of research objects as one key aspect towards its establishment. Focused on the specific needs of Earth Science communities, we propose extensions to research object representation models and present novel methods and tools to enrich research object metadata through automatic means. Finally, we validate the approach through the implementation of a recommender system that exploits the resulting metadata to facilitate research object discovery and reuse, enabling humans and machines to work together and accelerate the research life cycle.",

In this poster we present our work with Earth Science communities, that have embraced the research object model for long-term preservation and reuse of knowledge, to design checklists, the main tool available to assess the quality of research objects and upon which quality metrics such completeness, stability and reliability are calculated.",
