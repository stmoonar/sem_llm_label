            "abstract": "Natural language understanding typically maps single utterances to a dual level semantic frame, sentence level intent and slot labels at the word level. The best performing models force explicit interaction between intent detection and slot filling. We present a novel tri-level joint natural language understanding approach, adding domain, and explicitly exchange semantic information between all levels. This approach enables the use of multi-turn datasets which are a more natural conversational environment than single utterance. We evaluate our model on two multi-turn datasets for which we are the first to conduct joint slot-filling and intent detection. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art joint models in slot filling and intent detection on multi-turn data sets. We provide an analysis of explicit interaction locations between the layers. We conclude that including domain information improves model performance.",

            "title": "Organizing musical pieces by tonal similarity",
            "abstract": "Modeling the change of tonal content has a number of important applications from music retrieval to sound analysis. In this work, we build a system to find similarities in tonal content between different music performances. We map the Fourier Transform magnitudes to the twelve semitone pitch classes (chromas) to generate a sequence of \"pitch class profiles\" (PCPs) and then use them to represent each piece stored in an audio file. The evolution of tonal content is modeled using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs; Rabiner and Juang, 1986). An HMM is a finite set of states, each of which is associated with a probability distribution. Transitions among the states are governed by a set of transition probabilities. In a particular state an observation is generated from the associated probability distribution. We use the Baum-Welch algorithm to find the most likely set of state transition and output probabilities, given the set of observations. Then the Viterbi algorithm is employed during the testing phase to find the most likely sequence of hidden states that correspond to the testing output sequence. In this context, each probability distribution represents a particular tonal quality at one instant in time and the transitions between states correspond to changes in tonal content.",
