            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been damaging to the lives of people all around the world. Accompanied by the pandemic is an infodemic, an abundant and uncontrolled spread of potentially harmful misinformation. The infodemic may severely change the pandemic\u2019s course by interfering with public health interventions such as wearing masks, social distancing, and vaccination. In particular, the impact of the infodemic on vaccination is critical because it holds the key to reverting to pre-pandemic normalcy. This paper presents findings from a global survey on the extent of worldwide exposure to the COVID-19 infodemic, assesses different populations\u2019 susceptibility to false claims, and analyzes its association with vaccine acceptance. Based on responses gathered from over 18,400 individuals from 40 countries, we find a strong association between perceived believability of COVID-19 misinformation and vaccination hesitancy. Our study shows that only half of the online users exposed to rumors might have seen corresponding fact-checked information. Moreover, depending on the country, between 6% and 37% of individuals considered these rumors believable. A key finding of this research is that poorer regions were more susceptible to encountering and believing COVID-19 misinformation; countries with lower gross domestic product (GDP) per capita showed a substantially higher prevalence of misinformation. We discuss implications of our findings to public campaigns that proactively spread accurate information to countries that are more susceptible to the infodemic. We also defend that fact-checking platforms should prioritize claims that not only have wide exposure but are also perceived to be believable. Our findings give insights into how to successfully handle risk communication during the initial phase of a future pandemic.",

            "abstract": "COVID-19 has become one of the most widely talked about topics on social media. This research characterizes risk communication patterns by analyzing the public discourse on the novel coronavirus from four Asian countries: South Korea, Iran, Vietnam, and India, which suffered the outbreak to different degrees. The temporal analysis shows that the official epidemic phases issued by governments do not match well with the online attention on COVID-19. This finding calls for a need to analyze the public discourse by new measures, such as topical dynamics. Here, we propose an automatic method to detect topical phase transitions and compare similarities in major topics across these countries over time. We examine the time lag difference between social media attention and confirmed patient counts. For dynamics, we find an inverse relationship between the tweet count and topical diversity.",

            "abstract": "Continual labeling of training examples is a costly task in supervised learning. Active learning strategies mitigate this cost by identifying unlabeled data that are considered the most useful for training a predictive model. However, sample selection via active learning may lead to an exploitation-exploration dilemma. In online settings, profitable items can be neglected when uncertain items are annotated instead. To illustrate this dilemma, we study a human-in-the-loop customs selection scenario where an AI-based system supports customs officers by providing a set of imports to be inspected. If the inspected items are fraud, officers levy extra duties, and these items will be used as additional training data for the next iterations. Inspecting highly suspicious items will inevitably lead to additional customs revenue, yet they may not give any extra knowledge to customs officers. On the other hand, inspecting uncertain items will help customs officers to acquire new knowledge, which will be used as supplementary training resources to update their selection systems. Through years of customs selection simulation, we show that some exploration is needed to cope with the domain shift, and our hybrid strategy of selecting fraud and uncertain items will eventually outperform the performance of the exploitation strategy.",

            "abstract": "Intentional manipulation of invoices that lead to undervaluation of trade goods is the most common type of customs fraud to avoid ad valorem duties and taxes. To secure government revenue without interrupting legitimate trade flows, customs administrations around the world strive to develop ways to detect illicit trades. This paper proposes DATE, a model of Dual-task Attentive Tree-aware Embedding, to classify and rank illegal trade flows that contribute the most to the overall customs revenue when caught. The strength of DATE comes from combining a tree-based model for interpretability and transaction-level embeddings with dual attention mechanisms. To accurately identify illicit transactions and predict tax revenue, DATE learns simultaneously from illicitness and surtax of each transaction. With a five-year amount of customs import data with a test illicit ratio of 2.24%, DATE shows a remarkable precision of 92.7% on illegal cases and a recall of 49.3% on revenue after inspecting only 1% of all trade flows. We also discuss issues on deploying DATE in Nigeria Customs Service, in collaboration with the World Customs Organization.",

            "abstract": "Reducing unplanned readmissions is a major focus of current hospital quality efforts. In order to avoid unfair penalization, administrators and policymakers use prediction models to adjust for the performance of hospitals from healthcare claims data. Regression-based models are a commonly utilized method for such risk-standardization across hospitals; however, these models often suffer in accuracy. In this study we, compare four prediction models for unplanned patient readmission for patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive health failure (HF), and pneumonia (PNA) within the Nationwide Readmissions Database in 2014. We evaluated hierarchical logistic regression and compared its performance with gradient boosting and two models that utilize artificial neural network. We show that unsupervised Global Vector for Word Representations embedding representations of administrative claims data combined with artificial neural network classification models significantly improves prediction of 30-day readmission. Our best models increased the AUC for prediction of 30-day readmissions from 0.68 to 0.72 for AMI, 0.60 to 0.64 for HF, and 0.63 to 0.68 for PNA compared to hierarchical logistic regression. Furthermore, risk-standardized hospital readmission rates calculated from our artificial neural network model that employed embeddings led to reclassification of approximately 10% of hospitals across categories of hospital performance. This finding suggests that prediction models that incorporate new methods classify hospitals differently than traditional regression-based approaches and that their role in assessing hospital performance warrants further investigation.",

We used an inverted index of approximately 100 million notes to obtain the frequency of various permutations of ages, including biologically implausible ages as well as age descriptions that might not be detected by many de-identification systems. Missing such rare, but nevertheless present, variations could result in missed information or even privacy violations.",

            "abstract": "High utilizers of the Emergency Department (ED) often have complex needs that require coordination of care between multiple organizations. We describe a Learning Health Systems (LHS) approach to reducing ED visits, in which an intervention is delivered to a cohort of high utilizers identified using population-level data and predictive modeling. We focus on the development and validation of a random forest model that utilizes electronic health record data from three health systems across two counties in Michigan to predict the number of ED visits each resident will incur in the next six months. Using 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieves a root-mean-squared-error of 0.51 visits and a mean absolute error of 0.24 visits. Using time-based validation, the model achieves a root-mean-squared error of 0.74 visits and a mean absolute error of 0.29 visits. Patients projected to have high ED utilization are being enrolled in a community-wide care coordination intervention using twelve sites across two counties. We believe that the repeated cycles of modeling and intervention demonstrate an LHS in action.",
