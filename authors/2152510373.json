            "abstract": "Due to the flexibility and ease of control, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been increasingly used in various scenarios and applications in recent years. Training UAVs with reinforcement learning (RL) for a specific task is often expensive in terms of time and computation. However, it is known that the main effort of the learning process is made to fit the low-level physical dynamics systems instead of the high-level task itself. In this paper, we study to apply UAVs in the dynamic target intercept (DTI) task, where the dynamics systems equipped by different UAV models are correspondingly distinct. To this end, we propose a dynamics and task decoupled RL architecture to address the inefficient learning procedure, where the RL module focuses on modeling the DTI task without involving physical dynamics, and the design of states, actions, and rewards are completely task-oriented while the dynamics control module can adaptively convert actions from the RL module to dynamics signals to control different UAVs without retraining the RL module. We show the efficiency and efficacy of our results in comparison and ablation experiments against state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Skeleton-based human action recognition and analysis have become increasingly attainable in many areas, such as security surveillance and anomaly detection. Given the prevalence of skeleton-based applications, tampering attacks on human skeletal features have emerged very recently. In particular, checking the temporal inconsistency and/or incoherence (TII) in the skeletal sequence of human action is a principle of forgery detection. To this end, we propose an approach to self-supervised learning of the temporal causality behind human action, which can effectively check TII in skeletal sequences. Especially, we design a multilevel skeleton-based forgery detection framework to recognize the forgery on frame level, clip level, and action level in terms of learning the corresponding temporal-causal skeleton representations for each level. Specifically, a hierarchical graph convolution network architecture is designed to learn low-level skeleton representations based on physical skeleton connections and high-level action representations based on temporal-causal dependencies for specific actions. Extensive experiments consistently show state-of-the-art results on multilevel forgery detection tasks and superior performance of our framework compared to current competing methods.",

            "abstract": "Fashion recommendation (FR) has received increasing attention in the research of new types of recommender systems. Existing fashion recommender systems (FRSs) typically focus on clothing item suggestions for users in three scenarios: 1) how to best recommend fashion items preferred by users; 2) how to best compose a complete outfit, and 3) how to best complete a clothing ensemble. However, current FRSs often overlook an important aspect when making FR, that is, the compatibility of the clothing item or outfit recommendations is highly dependent on the scene context. To this end, we propose the scene-aware fashion recommender system (SAFRS), which uncovers a hitherto unexplored avenue where scene information is taken into account when constructing the FR model. More specifically, our SAFRS addresses this problem by encoding scene and outfit information in separation attention encoders and then fusing the resulting feature embeddings via a novel scene-aware compatibility score function. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted to show that our SAFRS model outperforms all baselines for every evaluated metric.",

            "abstract": "Matrix factorization (MF) is a popular method for collaborative filtering. Recently, more and more MF methods have been proposed to incorporate side information. However, most of them are vulnerable to changes in data or sub-models. Moreover, data often follows a Pareto distribution and such an imbalance of data leads to a biased global mean, affecting the prediction accuracy. To overcome these defects, we designed a Hierarchical Generalized Linear Model-based MF method (HGLMMF) which can leverage both the original and processed side information. More specifically, HGLMMF utilizes one portion of the side information to construct covariates for fixed effects and the other portion to model the cluster-specific effects to adjust the global-bias problem. In fact, a number of state-of-the-art MF models can be viewed as special cases of HGLMMF. The obtained prediction results from experiments prove that HGLMMF is highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods.",

This paper introduces Dbias ( https://pypi.org/project/Dbias/) , which is a Python package to ensure fairness in news articles. Dbias is a trained Machine Learning (ML) pipeline that can take a text (e.g., a paragraph or news story) and detects if the text is biased or not. Then, it detects the biased words in the text, masks them, and recommends a set of sentences with new words that are bias-free or at least less biased. We incorporate the elements of data science best practices to ensure that this pipeline is reproducible and usable. We show in experiments that this pipeline can be effective for mitigating biases and outperforms the common neural network architectures in ensuring fairness in the news articles.",

It is important to expose users to a variety of information. Diversity is required in a news recommender system not only so that users do not get bored of reading similar news but because so that they do not get trapped in information bubbles. We propose a deep neural network based on a two-tower architecture that learns news representation through a news item tower and users\u2019 representations through a query tower. To learn diversity, we introduce a category loss function that aligns items\u2019 representation of uneven news categories.

            "abstract": "Building on deep representation learning, deep supervised hashing has achieved promising performance in tasks like similarity retrieval. However, conventional code balance constraints (i.e., bit balance and bit uncorrelation) imposed on avoiding overfitting and improving hash code quality are unsuitable for deep supervised hashing owing to their inefficiency and impracticality of simultaneously learning deep data representations and hash functions. To address this issue, we propose probabilistic code balance constraints on deep supervised hashing to force each hash code to conform to a discrete uniform distribution. Accordingly, a Wasserstein regularizer aligns the distribution of generated hash codes to a uniform distribution. Theoretical analyses reveal that the proposed constraints form a general deep hashing framework for both bit balance and bit uncorrelation and maximizing the mutual information between data input and their corresponding hash codes. Extensive empirical analyses on two benchmark datasets further demonstrate the enhancement of compactness and informativeness of hash codes for deep supervised hash to improve retrieval performance (code available at: https://github.com/mumuxi/dshwr).",

To this end, we design a time-aware joint model to infer users\u2019 preference for the newly-published papers with the help of subsidiary relations of social and article linkages. The temporal preference of researchers for articles is jointly modeled with social and article relations by a group of matrices sharing common dimensions of researchers and articles. A joint multi-relational factorization algorithm is devised to approximate the latent factor matrices along with a temporal recommendation algorithm to predict the personalized new referential papers based on the factor matrices.
