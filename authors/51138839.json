            "abstract": "Chronic disease management and follow-up are vital for realizing sustained patient well-being and optimal health outcomes. Recent advancements in wearable sensing technologies, particularly wrist-worn devices, offer promising solutions for longitudinal patient follow-up by shifting from subjective, intermittent self-reporting to objective, continuous monitoring. However, collecting and analyzing wearable data presents unique challenges, such as data entry errors, non-wear periods, missing wearable data, and wearable artifacts. We therefore present an in-depth exploration of data analysis challenges tied to wrist-worn wearables and ambulatory label acquisition, using two real-world datasets (i.e., mBrain21 and ETRI lifelog2020). We introduce novel practical countermeasures, including participant compliance visualizations, interaction-triggered questionnaires to assess personal bias, and an optimized wearable non-wear detection pipeline. Further, we propose a visual analytics approach to validate processing pipelines using scalable tools such as tsflex and Plotly-Resampler. Lastly, we investigate the impact of missing wearable data on\"window-of-interest\"analysis methodologies. Prioritizing transparency and reproducibility, we offer open access to our detailed code examples, facilitating adaptation in future wearable research. In conclusion, our contributions provide actionable approaches for wearable data collection and analysis in chronic disease management.",

            "abstract": "Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data from heterogeneous sources with domain knowledge and context information in real-time is a challenging task in IoT healthcare data management applications that can be solved with semantics. Existing IoT platforms often have issues with preserving the privacy of patient data. Moreover, configuring and managing context-aware stream processing queries in semantic IoT platforms requires much manual, labor-intensive effort. Generic queries can deal with context changes but often lead to performance issues caused by the need for expressive real-time semantic reasoning. In addition, query window parameters are part of the manual configuration and cannot be made context-dependent. To tackle these problems, this paper presents DIVIDE, a component for a semantic IoT platform that adaptively derives and manages the queries of the platform\u2019s stream processing components in a context-aware and scalable manner, and that enables privacy by design. By performing semantic reasoning to derive the queries when context changes are observed, their real-time evaluation does require any reasoning. The results of an evaluation on a homecare monitoring use case demonstrate how activity detection queries derived with DIVIDE can be evaluated in on average less than 3.7 seconds and can therefore successfully run on low-end IoT devices.",

By making the algorithm available in the most popular data science language, and by bundling all extensions into a single place, the use of RDF2Vec is simplified for data scientists. The package is released under a MIT license and structured in such a way to foster further research into sampling, walking, and embedding strategies, which are vital components of the RDF2Vec algorithm. Several optimisations have been implemented in \\texttt{pyRDF2Vec} that allow for more efficient walk extraction than the original algorithm. Furthermore, best practices in terms of code styling, testing, and documentation were applied such that the package is future-proof as well as to facilitate external contributions.",

            "abstract": "Headache disorders are experienced by many people around the world. In current clinical practice, the follow-up and diagnosis of headache disorder patients only happens intermittently, based on subjective data self-reported by the patient. The mBrain system tries to make this process more continuous, autonomous and objective by additionally collecting contextual and physiological data via a wearable, mobile app and machine learning algorithms. To support the monitoring of headache symptoms during attacks for headache classification and the detection of headache triggers, much knowledge and contextual data is available from heterogeneous sources, which can be consolidated with semantics. This paper presents a demonstrator of knowledge-driven services that perform these tasks using Semantic Web technologies. These services are deployed in a distributed cascading architecture that includes DIVIDE to derive and manage the RDF stream processing queries that perform the contextually relevant filtering in an intelligent and efficient way.",

            "abstract": "Messenger RNA-based medicines hold immense potential, as evidenced by their rapid deployment as COVID-19 vaccines. However, worldwide distribution of mRNA molecules has been limited by their thermostability, which is fundamentally limited by the intrinsic instability of RNA molecules to a chemical degradation reaction called in-line hydrolysis. Predicting the degradation of an RNA molecule is a key task in designing more stable RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we describe a crowdsourced machine learning competition (\u201cStanford OpenVaccine\u201d) on Kaggle, involving single-nucleotide resolution measurements on 6043 102\u2013130-nucleotide diverse RNA constructs that were themselves solicited through crowdsourcing on the RNA design platform Eterna. The entire experiment was completed in less than 6 months, and 41% of nucleotide-level predictions from the winning model were within experimental error of the ground truth measurement. Furthermore, these models generalized to blindly predicting orthogonal degradation data on much longer mRNA molecules (504\u20131588 nucleotides) with improved accuracy compared to previously published models. Top teams integrated natural language processing architectures and data augmentation techniques with predictions from previous dynamic programming models for RNA secondary structure. These results indicate that such models are capable of representing in-line hydrolysis with excellent accuracy, supporting their use for designing stabilized messenger RNAs. The integration of two crowdsourcing platforms, one for data set creation and another for machine learning, may be fruitful for other urgent problems that demand scientific discovery on rapid timescales.",

            "abstract": "In industry, dashboards are often used to monitor fleets of assets, such as trains, machines or buildings. In such industrial fleets, the vast amount of sensors evolves continuously, new sensor data exchange protocols and data formats are introduced, new visualization types may need to be introduced and existing dashboard visualizations may need to be updated in terms of displayed sensors. These requirements motivate the development of dynamic dashboarding applications. These, as opposed to fixed-structure dashboard applications, allow users to create visualizations at will and do not have hard-coded sensor bindings. The state-of-the-art in dynamic dashboarding does not cope well with the frequent additions and removals of sensors that must be monitored\u2014these changes must still be configured in the implementation or at runtime by a user. Also, the user is presented with an overload of sensors, aggregations and visualizations to select from, which may sometimes even lead to the creation of dashboard widgets that do not make sense. In this paper, we present a dynamic dashboard that overcomes these problems. Sensors, visualizations and aggregations can be discovered automatically, since they are provided as RESTful Web Things on a Web Thing Model compliant gateway. The gateway also provides semantic annotations of the Web Things, describing what their abilities are. A semantic reasoner can derive visualization suggestions, given the Thing annotations, logic rules and a custom dashboard ontology. The resulting dashboarding application automatically presents the available sensors, visualizations and aggregations that can be used, without requiring sensor configuration, and assists the user in building dashboards that make sense. This way, the user can concentrate on interpreting the sensor data and detecting and solving operational problems early.",

            "abstract": ". To train knowledge graph embedding models, negative training examples have to be generated arti\ufb01cially. A few attempts were already made in the past to improve negative sampling by exploiting schematic domain and range constraints. However, such approaches did not exploit the full range of schematic axioms. To remedy this situation, we introduce a new type of conditional constraints based on OWL restrictions. Additionally, we investigate two alternative views on how constraints might be used to generate false triples\u2014an open world view and a closed world view\u2014and perform empirical evaluations for both of them. Our results indicate that in the closed world view, even a limited number of OWL constraints can improve link prediction performance. Also, for regular constraints, both open world and closed world views offer signi\ufb01cant improvements with respect to baseline negative sampling techniques.",

While it has been shown empirically that these techniques often achieve better predictive performances than their classical counterparts, where features are extracted from the graph, they lack interpretability. Interpretability is a vital aspect in critical domains such as the health and financial sector. In this paper, we present a technique that builds a decision tree of class-specific substructures in order to classify different entities within the knowledge graph. We show how our proposed technique is competitive to current state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques on four benchmark datasets, while being fully interpretable.",
