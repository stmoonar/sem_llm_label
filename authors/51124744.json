            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Workflows make it easier for scientists to assemble computational experiments consisting of many disparate components. However, those disparate components also increase the probability that the computational experiment fails to be reproducible. Even if software is reproducible today, it may become irreproducible tomorrow without the software itself changing at all, because of the constantly changing software environment in which the software is run. To alleviate irreproducibility, workflow engines integrate with container engines. Additionally, communities that sprung up around workflow engines started to host registries for workflows that follow standards. These standards reduce the effort needed to make workflows automatically reproducible. In this paper, we study automatic reproduction of workflows from two registries, focusing on non-crashing executions. The experimental data lets us analyze the upper bound to which workflow engines could achieve reproducibility. We identify lessons learned in achieving reproducibility in practice.",

            "title": "On-Device CPU Scheduling for Sense-React Systems",
            "abstract": "Sense-react systems (e.g. robotics and AR/VR) have to take highly responsive real-time actions, driven by complex decisions involving a pipeline of sensing, perception, planning, and reaction tasks. These tasks must be scheduled on resource-constrained devices such that the performance goals and the requirements of the application are met. This is a difficult scheduling problem that requires handling multiple scheduling dimensions, and variations in resource usage and availability. In practice, system designers manually tune parameters for their specific hardware and application, which results in poor generalization and increases the development burden. In this work, we highlight the emerging need for scheduling CPU resources at runtime in sense-react systems. We study three canonical applications (face tracking, robot navigation, and VR) to first understand the key scheduling requirements for such systems. Armed with this understanding, we develop a scheduling framework, Catan, that dynamically schedules compute resources across different components of an app so as to meet the specified application requirements. Through experiments with a prototype implemented on a widely-used robotics framework (ROS) and an open-source AR/VR platform, we show the impact of system scheduling on meeting the performance goals for the three applications, how Catan is able to achieve better application performance than hand-tuned configurations, and how it dynamically adapts to runtime variations.",

Through conversations and interviews among the program managers, project leads, and software engineers, we have developed critical insight and strategies to overcome the obstacles and augment the successful adoption and long-term use of these workflows in ExaAM and beyond.

            "abstract": "Robots have to take highly responsive real-time actions, driven by complex decisions involving a pipeline of sensing, perception, planning, and reaction tasks. These tasks must be scheduled on resource-constrained devices such that the performance goals and the requirements of the application are met. This is a difficult problem that requires handling multiple scheduling dimensions, and variations in computational resource usage and availability. In practice, system designers manually tune parameters for their specific hardware and application, which results in poor generalization and increases the development burden. In this work, we highlight the emerging need for scheduling CPU resources at runtime in robot systems. We use robot navigation as a case-study to understand the key scheduling requirements for such systems. Armed with this understanding, we develop a CPU scheduling framework, Catan, that dynamically schedules compute resources across different components of an app so as to meet the specified application requirements. Through experiments with a prototype implemented on ROS, we show the impact of system scheduling on meeting the application's performance goals, and how Catan dynamically adapts to runtime variations.",

            "abstract": "Open-source research software plays a central role in accelerating advances in science and engineering. Its increasing significance, however, incentivizes malicious actors to attack that software and compromise the systems on which it runs, undermining the free and open exchange of trustworthy research codes. In the world of conventional software development, there has been a shift towards integrating security as early as possible in the development process to guard against malicious activity. Given the potential risks at hand, developers of research software must consider how to do the same across the research software lifecycle. This editorial argues for the need to unite diverse forms of expertise in scientific computing and software security to address these challenges and outlines a roadmap for future work in this space.",

            "abstract": "Hardware specialization is becoming a key enabler of energy-efficient performance. Future systems will be increasingly heterogeneous, integrating multiple specialized and programmable accelerators, each with different memory demands. Traditionally, communication between accelerators has been inefficient, typically orchestrated through explicit DMA transfers between different address spaces. More recently, industry has proposed unified coherent memory which enables implicit data movement and more data reuse, but often these interfaces limit the coherence flexibility available to heterogeneous systems. This paper demonstrates the benefits of fine-grained coherence specialization for heterogeneous systems. We propose an architecture that enables low-complexity independent specialization of each individual coherence request in heterogeneous workloads by building upon a simple and flexible baseline coherence interface, Spandex. We then describe how to optimize individual memory requests to improve cache reuse and performance-critical memory latency in emerging heterogeneous workloads. Collectively, our techniques enable significant gains, reducing execution time by up to 61% or network traffic by up to 99% while adding minimal complexity to the Spandex protocol.",

            "abstract": "An increasing number of edge systems have large computational demands, stringent resource constraints, and end-to-end quality-driven goodness metrics. Architects have embraced domain-specific accelerators to meet the demands of such systems. We make the case for research that shifts emphasis from domain-specific accelerators to domain-specific systems, with a consequent shift from evaluations using benchmarks that are collections of independent applications to those using testbeds that are full integrated systems. We describe extended reality (XR) as an exciting domain motivating such domain-specific systems research, but hampered by the lack of an end-to-end evaluation testbed. We present ILLIXR (Illinois Extended Reality testbed), the first fully open source XR system and research testbed. ILLIXR enables system innovations with end-to-end co-designed hardware, compiler, OS, and algorithm, and driven by end-user perceived quality-of-experience (QoE) metrics. Using ILLIXR, we perform the first comprehensive quantitative analysis of performance, power, and QoE for a complete XR system and its individual components. We describe several implications of our results that propel new directions in architecture, systems, and algorithm research for domain-specific systems in general, and XR in particular, all enabled by ILLIXR.",
