In particular, AI has been used to handle various types of data (including numerical, textual and image data) and has been adopted in large-scale distributed systems. From a data management perspective, this calls for the harnessing of state-of-the-art AI solutions for data management tasks and systems. aiDM is a full-day workshop that offers a stage for innovative interdisciplinary research that studies the interaction between AI and data management and develops new AI technologies for data-related tasks. This year, aiDM'24 particularly focuses on the transparent exploitation of AI techniques (e.g., using Generative AI frameworks) for data management for enterprise class workloads.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic road network optimization has been used for improving traffic flow in an infrequent and localized manner. The development of intelligent systems and technology provides an opportunity to improve the frequency and scale of dynamic road network optimization. However, such improvements are hindered by the high computational complexity of the existing algorithms that generate the optimization plans. We present a novel solution that integrates machine learning and road network optimization. Our solution consists of two complementary parts. The first part is an efficient algorithm that uses reinforcement learning to find the best road network configurations at real-time. The second part is a dynamic routing mechanism, which helps connected vehicles adapt to the change of the road network. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the average travel time in a variety of scenarios, whilst being computationally efficient and hence applicable to real-life situations.",

Furthermore, fast training methods\u2014ones that train in one pass\u2014may not learn the data distribution well. To consider both the fitness to data distribution and building efficiency, in this paper, we apply pre-trained models and fine-tuning to accelerate the building of learned indices by 30.4% and improve lookup efficiency by up to 24.4% on real datasets and 22.5% on skewed datasets.",

            "abstract": "While early empirical evidence has supported the case for learned index structures as having favourable average-case performance, little is known about their worst-case performance. By contrast, classical structures are known to achieve optimal worst-case behaviour. This work evaluates the robustness of learned index structures in the presence of adversarial workloads. To simulate adversarial work-loads, we carry out a data poisoning attack on linear regression models that manipulates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) on which the learned index model is trained. The attack deteriorates the fit of the underlying ML model by injecting a set of poisoning keys into the training dataset, which leads to an increase in the prediction error of the model and thus deteriorates the overall performance of the learned index structure. We assess the performance of various regression methods and the learned index implementations ALEX and PGM-Index. We show that learned index structures can suffer from a significant performance deterioration of up to 20% when evaluated on poisoned vs. non-poisoned datasets.",

Existing theories demonstrate that to facilitate inclusion, multiple types of exclusionary dynamics, such as self-segregation, communication apprehension, and stereotyping and stigmatizing, must be overcome [11]. A diverse group of people tends to surface different perspectives, which help to understand and address D&I. Fostering D&I in research communities must address issues related to inclusive interpersonal and small group dynamics, rules and codes of conduct, increasing diversity in under-represented groups and disciplines, and organizing D&I events, and longterm efforts to champion change [15].",

            "abstract": "Missing data in Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) are an unavoidable consequence of data collection by non\u2010experts, guided by only vague and informal mapping guidelines. While various Missing Value Imputation (MVI) techniques have been proposed as data cleansing strategies, they have primarily targeted numerical data attributes in non\u2010spatial databases. There remains a significant gap in methods for imputing nominal attribute values (e.g., Street Name) in map databases. Here, we present an imputation algorithm called the Membership Imputation Algorithm (MIA), targeting spatial databases and enabling imputation of nominal values in spatially referenced records. By targeting membership classes of spatial objects, MIA harnesses spatio\u2010temporal characteristics of data and proposes efficient heuristics to impute the class name (i.e., a membership). Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to impute the membership with high levels of accuracy (over 94%) when assigning Street Name(s), across highly diverse regional contexts. MIA is effective in challenging spatial contexts such as street intersections. Our research serves as a first step in highlighting the effectiveness of spatio\u2010temporal measures as a key driver for nominal imputation techniques.",

            "abstract": "Modern industrial, government, and academic organizations are collecting massive amounts of data at an unprecedented scale and pace. The ability to perform timely, predictable and cost-effective analytical processing of such large data sets in order to extract deep insights is now a key ingredient for success. Traditional database systems (DBMS) are, however, not the first choice for servicing these modern applications, despite 40 years of database research. This is due to the fact that modern applications exhibit different behavior from the one assumed by DBMS: a) timely data exploration as a new trend is characterized by ad-hoc queries and a short user interaction period, leaving little time for DBMS to do good performance tuning, b) accurate statistics representing relevant summary information about distributions of ever increasing data are frequently missing, resulting in suboptimal plan decisions and consequently poor and unpredictable query execution performance, and c) cloud service providers - a major winner in the data analytics game due to the low cost of (shared) storage - have shifted the control over data storage from DBMS to the cloud providers, making it harder for DBMS to optimize data access. This thesis demonstrates that database systems can still provide timely, predictable and cost-effective analytical processing, if they use an agile and adaptive approach. In particular, DBMS need to adapt at three levels (to workload, data and hardware characteristics) in order to stabilize and optimize performance and cost when faced with requirements posed by modern data analytics applications. Workload-driven data ingestion is introduced with NoDB as a means to enable efficient data exploration and reduce the data-to-insight time (i.e., the time to load the data and tune the system) by doing these steps lazily and incrementally as a side-effect of posed queries as opposed to mandatory first steps. Data-driven runtime access path decision making introduced with Smooth Scan alleviates suboptimal query execution, postponing the decision on access paths from query optimization, where statistics are heavily exploited, to query execution, where the system can obtain more details about data distributions. Smooth Scan uses access path morphing from one physical alternative to another to fit the observed data distributions, which removes the need for a priori access path decisions and substantially improves the predictability of DBMS. Hardware-driven query execution introduced with Skipper enables the usage of cold storage devices (CSD) as a cost-effective solution for storing the ever increasing customer data. Skipper uses an out-of-order CSD-driven query execution model based on multi-way joins coupled with efficient cache and I/O scheduling policies to hide the non-uniform access latencies of CSD. This thesis advocates runtime adaptivity as a key to dealing with raising uncertainty about workload characteristics that modern data analytics applications exhibit. Overall, the techniques introduced in this thesis through the three levels of adaptivity (workload, data and hardware-driven adaptivity) increase the usability of database systems and the user satisfaction in the case of big data exploration, making low-cost data analytics reality.",
