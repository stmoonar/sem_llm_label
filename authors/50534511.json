            "abstract": "htmlabstractThe internet of things is predicated on tiny, cheap, lower \npower computers being embedded in devices everywhere. \nHowever such tiny devices by definition have very little \nmemory and computing power available to support user \ninterfaces or extended servers, and so the user interface needs \nto be distributed over the network. \n \nThis paper describes techniques using standard \ntechnologies based on XML for creating remote user interfaces \nfor the Internet of Things",
