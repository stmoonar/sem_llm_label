            "abstract": "In this article, a method of extending airborne weather radar modeling to incorporate high-ice-water-content (HIWC) conditions has been developed. A novel aspect is incorporating flight test measurement data, including forward-looking radar measurements and in situ microphysics probes data, into the model and part of the evaluations of modeling. The simulation models assume a dual-polarized, airborne forward-looking radar, while for single-polarized operations, the index-of-dispersion is included as a helpful indicator for HIWC detection. The radar system simulation models are useful for design evaluations for the next generation of airborne aviation hazard monitoring and incorporate HIWC hazard detection algorithms. Example applications of the simulator, such as hazard detection based on the simulated HIWC flight encounter scenarios based on specific numeric weather prediction (NWP) model outputs, are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Currently there is a tremendous gap in observations of global air pressure fields although many satellite remote sensing techniques have been developed in measuring certain atmospheric variables such as temperature and moisture in last few decades. Air pressure is the key variable for the Earth's dynamic fields. This study explores the potential of global surface air pressure measurements using a satellite active microwave sensing technique, namely the Differential-absorption BArometric Radar (DiBAR), to improve weather forecasts, particularly severe weather such as typhoon predictions. The research team at NASA Langley has developed a prototype instrument and demonstrated its performance through ground and airborne experiments. Spacebome capability of this measurement approach will significantly improve typhoon and severe weather forecasts.",

            "title": "Differential absorption microwave radar measurements for remote sensing of atmospheric pressure",
            "abstract": "The accuracy of numerical weather model predictions of the intensity and track of tropical storms may be improved by large spatial coverage and frequent sampling of sea surface barometry. The feasibility of a microwave radar operating at moderate to strong O2 absorption bands in the frequency range of 50~56 GHz to remotely measure surface barometric pressure may provide such capability. At these radar wavelengths, the reflection of radar echoes from water surfaces is strongly attenuated by atmospheric column O2. Because of the uniform mixture of O2 gases within the atmosphere, the total atmospheric column O2 is proportional to atmospheric path lengths and the total atmospheric column air, and thus, to surface barometric pressures. Recent research has developed a technique based on the use of a dual-frequency, O2-band radar to overcome many of the difficulties associated with techniques requiring larger frequency separation. The ratio of reflected radar signals at multiple wavelengths are used to minimize the effect of microwave absorption by liquid water, water vapor in the atmosphere and the influences of sea surface reflection over the frequency of operation. Langley Research Center (LaRC) has developed a radar based on this measurement technique to estimate barometric pressure. This paper will present an overview of the differential absorption measurement concept and will discuss a radar instrument to verify the differential O2 absorption measurement approach. Results of instrument functional testing and initial measurements will be presented.",

            "title": "Real-time enhanced vision system",
            "abstract": "Flying in poor visibility conditions, such as rain, snow, fog or haze, is inherently dangerous. However these conditions can occur at nearly any location, so inevitably pilots must successfully navigate through them. At NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), under support of the Aviation Safety and Security Program Office and the Systems Engineering Directorate, we are developing an Enhanced Vision System (EVS) that combines image enhancement and synthetic vision elements to assist pilots flying through adverse weather conditions. This system uses a combination of forward-looking infrared and visible sensors for data acquisition. A core function of the system is to enhance and fuse the sensor data in order to increase the information content and quality of the captured imagery. These operations must be performed in real-time for the pilot to use while flying. For image enhancement, we are using the LaRC patented Retinex algorithm since it performs exceptionally well for improving low-contrast range imagery typically seen during poor visibility poor visibility conditions. In general, real-time operation of the Retinex requires specialized hardware. To date, we have successfully implemented a single-sensor real-time version of the Retinex on several different Digital Signal Processor (DSP) platforms. In this paper we give an overview of the EVS and its performance requirements for real-time enhancement and fusion and we discuss our current real-time Retinex implementations on DSPs.",
