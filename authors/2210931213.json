            "abstract": "This letter is the third report from a series of IEEE TIV's decentralized and hybrid workshops (DHWs) on intelligent vehicles for education (IV4E). Autonomous racing serves as a vital platform for nurturing engineering talents among university students, contributing to the development of skills essential for the intelligent vehicle industry. This letter investigates how recent emerging techniques, such as large language models (LLMs) and the Metaverse, can contribute to organizing IV4E-oriented autonomous racing events. Among these DHWs, scholars from diverse fields have collectively explored the integration of LLMs and the Metaverse into autonomous racing for educational purposes. The discussions emphasize the role of Metaverse in creating dynamic and immersive training virtual reality platforms and the role of LLMs in enhancing race commentary and the spectator experience. Within this context, the Metaverse introduces complex scenarios to the racetrack, maintaining suspense about the winning team until a race's final moment. This dynamic feature excites the race and motivates the participating teams to intensify their competition efforts. LLMs facilitate personalized commentary, inspiring spectators to become future participants in these races. Our DHWs highlighted a future in which technology, autonomy, and education intersect, fostering inclusive, educational, and engaging autonomous racing events.",

We have identified the authors, institutions, and countries/regions that are the most productive and have the highest impact. It is found that research on intelligent vehicles is dominated by researchers and institutions from China. Researchers from the US are the second largest contributor to the transaction, whilst those from Germany rank the third. It is also found that, Fei-Yue Wang, Mohan Manubhai Trivedi, and J. Christian Gerdes are the three most productive and influential authors at IEEE TIV, and the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National University of Defense Technology, and the University of California, are three most productive and influential institutions. In addition, three networks are generated (i.e., the co-authorship, co-keyword, and author-keyword) to mine collaboration patterns among authors and keywords. Collaboration relationship between researchers and hot research topics are also investigated. Furthermore, an open-source tool is developed to automatically collect metadata, perform bibliographic analysis, and mine collaboration patterns.",

            "abstract": "This letter reports on a TIV DHW (decentralized and hybrid workshop) that explores the prospective influence of ChatGPT on research and development in intelligent vehicles. To assess the update capabilities of ChatGPT, we conducted tests involving both basic and technically relevant questions. Our preliminary testing revealed that ChatGPT's information can be updated and corrected at one time, but it may take some time for the changes to be reflected in ChatGPT's responses, so it may not always possess the latest knowledge regarding specific topics. We further discuss the prospective influence of ChatGPT on the field of intelligent vehicles, particularly possible applications of ChatGPT in areas like autonomous driving, human-vehicle interaction, and intelligent transportation systems, highlighting challenges and opportunities associated with these applications. Additionally, we address technical questions, such as the feasibility of training intelligent vehicles using the same methods as ChatGPT and the reflection of the intelligence of intelligent vehicles in the context of human-machine shared control. In conclusion, this letter presents a preliminary exploration of the potential of ChatGPT for intelligent vehicle research, from an IEEE TIV perspective, acknowledging the limitations and uncertainties of this emerging technology.",

The role of intelligent vehicles in promoting education for all ages through autonomous racing was discussed during a recent DHW. Over the past decade, autonomous racing has emerged due to advancements in self-driving technologies. While still focused on extreme speed, autonomous racing differs from conventional automobile racing in its development philosophy, as human drivers are no longer involved. The absence of human drivers should be regarded as a new chance to increase competitiveness and entertainment value. This letter discusses opportunities to promote education-oriented autonomous racing. Recall that the flagship car race is Formula 1, where \u201cformula\u201d denotes technical restrictions that should be satisfied strictly. We name the new race series Autonomous 1 or A1, leveraging the power of autonomous intelligence in education. The achievements made in Formula 1 and typical autonomous races are reviewed, followed by discussions about A1\u2019s future perspectives. Specifically, A1 needs to maintain race consistency, update rules, and provide personalized commentary to support all-age education.",

            "abstract": "Path planning is an essential function in an intelligent vehicle, especially when driving in scenarios cluttered by large-scale static obstacles. Traditional path planners often struggle to find a balance among speed, accuracy, and optimality in their solutions. In this article, we introduce an Adaptive Pure Pursuit (APP) planner, which is designed to be fast and near-optimal for autonomous driving in cluttered environments. The APP planner generates feasible paths through a simulated closed-loop tracking control process of a virtual vehicle. If a derived path encounters obstacles, an adaptive refinement step is taken to locally reduce these collisions. Unlike search-based planners that suffer from the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d and optimization-based methods that often run slowly, the APP planner operates extremely fast. The high speed stems from the fact that both the virtual controller simulation and the refinement step involve computations with zero degrees of freedom. The proposed APP planner outperforms the prevalent optimization-based and search-based path planners, as shown by comparative simulations.",

            "title": "Toward Fair and Thrilling Autonomous Racing: Governance Rules and Performance Metrics for the Autonomous One",
            "abstract": "This letter is the second report from a series of IEEE TIV's Decentralized and Hybrid Workshops (DHWs) on Intelligent Vehicles for Education (IV4E). It outlines the prospect of The Autonomous One (TAO), a future autonomous racing competition modeled after Formula One to advance IV4E by pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence. Existing autonomous races face challenges, including compromised fairness and low participant enthusiasm. These issues limit spectator engagement, thereby reducing the races\u2019 educational value. To prevent similar flaws in organizing TAO, our focus lies in setting governance rules from an organizer's perspective. In these DHWs, we analyzed the rules of existing autonomous races and suggested rule-making guidelines for TAO. To improve fairness, we recommend a balanced scoring system with rigorous monitoring of participating teams\u2019 performances. To discourage consistent victories by a single team, we suggest that leading teams share their source codes, thereby setting the championship-level performance as the baseline in the next season and accelerating the evolution of all participating teams\u2019 abilities. For enhancing suspense and spectator interest, an on-site adaptive rewarding scheme should be deployed to create thrilling turnarounds. Our strategies aim to maintain fairness, increase spectator interest, inspire competitiveness, and ultimately contribute to the advancement of IV4E in organizing TAO.",
