            "abstract": "Pretrained language models (PLMs) have made significant progress on various NLP tasks recently. However, PLMs encounter challenges when it comes to domain-specific tasks such as legal AI. These tasks often involve intricate expertise, expensive data annotation, and limited training data availability. To tackle this problem, we propose a human-oriented artificial\u2013natural parallel system for organized intelligence (HANOI)-Legal based on the parallel learning (PL) framework. First, by regarding the description in PL as the pretraining process based on a large-scale corpus, we setup an artificial system based on a PLM. Second, to adapt the PLM to legal tasks with limited resources, we propose UniPrompt as a prescription. UniPrompt serves as a unified prompt-based training framework, enabling the utilization of diverse open datasets for these tasks. Third, we labeled a few task-specific legal data through distributed autonomous operations (DAO-II) for further fine-tuning. By combining a scalable unified-task-format reformulation and a unified-prompt-based training pipeline, HANOI-Legal leverages PLMs\u2019 linguistic capabilities acquired from a variety of open datasets to generate task-specific models. Our experiments in two legal domain tasks show that HANOI-Legal achieved an excellent performance in low-resource scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art prompt-based approach.",

            "title": "Knowledge Graph-Based Reinforcement Federated Learning for Chinese Question and Answering",
            "abstract": "Knowledge question and answering (Q&A) is widely used. However, most existing semantic parsing methods in Q&A usually use cascading, which can incur error accumulation. In addition, using only one institution\u2019s Q&A data definitely will limit the Q&A performance, while data privacy prevents sharing between institutions. This article proposes a knowledge graph-based reinforcement federated learning (KGRFL)-based Q&A approach to address these challenges. We design an end-to-end multitask semantic parsing model [MSP-bidirectional and auto-regressive transformers (BART)] that identifies question categories while converting questions into SPARQL statements to improve semantic parsing. Meanwhile, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based model fusion strategy is proposed to improve the effectiveness of federated learning, which enables multi-institution joint modeling and data privacy protection using cross-domain knowledge. In particular, it also reduces the negative impact of low-quality clients on the global model. Furthermore, a prompt learning-based entity disambiguation method is proposed to address the semantic ambiguity problem because of joint modeling. The experiments show that the proposed method performs well on different datasets. The Q&A results of the proposed approach outperform the approach of using only a single institution. Experiments also demonstrate that the proposed approach is resilient to security attacks, which is required for real applications.",

Such kind of analysis should help the related departments sense and beware the situation effectively and efficiently, and may provide technical supports for proper policy making and responses. To facilitate this purpose, a new method is proposed and an abbreviated large-graph clustering (ALGC) algorithm has been designed to generate documents and topic representation for alleviating the overhead of high computational complexity of large graphs by reducing the dimensionality of the attention matrix and adjacency matrix. The evolution pattern of topics is also analyzed in and between different time periods. Experiment results show that the proposed method performs well, achieving a high clustering accuracy with lower computational cost. The dataset used in this article is also released for public analysis.",

In consideration of the cost, legal, and institutional constraints on the study of CPSS in real world, computational experiments have emerged as a new method for quantitative analysis of CPSS. However, with the increase of application scenarios, how to map complex and diverse domain models to artificial society models has become a key challenge to hinder the wide use of computational experiments. In this article, the docking framework between the domain model and the artificial society model was proposed in this article, and the model docking specification is given from three aspects: the agent model, the environmental model, and the rules model. In addition, the effectiveness of the framework was verified by two classic cases: artificial stock market and epidemic prevention and control. The result showed that the proposed model docking framework can provide technical support for the multidisciplinary applications of computational experiments and significantly reduce the difficulty of using the method.",

            "abstract": "Human travel and social contacts are deemed as the key force in driving the transmission of infectious diseases. Consequently, epidemic models should represent individuals\u2019 spatiotemporal contacts in detail to investigate the complex process of epidemic diffusion. Mathematical epidemic models usually assume a homogeneous human population and describe unstructured contacts. Most network-based epidemic models do not synthetically consider the temporal and spatial features of human structured contact behaviors. We here combined a social network with a bipartite network to build a multilayer agent network to model heterogeneous individuals\u2019 temporal and spatial structured contacts. We used the largest collective outbreak of H1N1 influenza at a Chinese university in 2009 as a case study. Experimental results indicate that our models can reproduce individuals\u2019 daily travel and social contact patterns, as well as the H1N1 influenza outbreak. We found that only quarantining dormitories to stop interbuilding transmission could not achieve a great effect in mitigating epidemic outbreaks at a university. The prohibition of students\u2019 visiting across dormitory rooms was indispensable to prevent intrabuilding transmission of infectious diseases. Furthermore, it would be better to quarantine admitted case patients\u2019 close contacts to control potentially latent individuals.",

            "abstract": "This paper utilizes parallel control to investigate the problem of event-triggered deep reinforcement learning and develops an event-triggered deep Q-network (ETDQN) for decision-making of autonomous driving, without training an explicit triggering condition. Based on the framework of parallel control, the developed ETDQN incorporates information of actions into the feedback and constructs a dynamic control policy. First, in the realization of the dynamic control policy, we integrate the current state and the previous action to construct the augmented state as well as the augmented Markov decision process. Meanwhile, it is shown theoretically that the goal of the developed dynamic control policy is to learn the variation rate of the action. The augmented state contains information of the current state and the previous action, which enables the developed ETDQN to directly design the immediate reward considering communication loss. Then, based on dueling double deep Q-network (dueling DDQN), we establish the augmented action-value, value, and advantage functions to directly learn the optimal event-triggered decision-making policy of autonomous driving without an explicit triggering condition. It is worth noticing that the developed ETDQN applies to various deep Q-networks (DQNs). Empirical results demonstrate that, in event-triggered control, the developed ETDQN outperforms dueling DDQN and reduces communication loss effectively.",

At the IEEE IS\u2019 AI and CPSS Department, we would like to initiate cautious, balanced, hopefully deep investigations to address various related issues on the impact and significance of intelligent science and technology to our economy and society. Let\u2019s start with the \u201cthree Bs\u201d and \u201cACP\u201d for parallel intelligence in CPSSs: Being by artificial systems (A), Becoming through computational experiments (C), and Believing with parallel execution (P).",

            "title": "A Novel Scenarios Engineering Methodology for Foundation Models in Metaverse",
            "abstract": "Foundation models are used to train a broad system of general data to build adaptations to new bottlenecks. Typically, they contain hundreds of billions of hyperparameters that have been trained with hundreds of gigabytes of data. However, this type of black-box vulnerability places foundation models at risk of data poisoning attacks that are designed to pass on misinformation or purposely introduce machine bias. Moreover, ordinary researchers have not been able to completely participate due to the rise in deployment standards. This study introduces the theoretical framework of scenarios engineering (SE) for building accessible and reliable foundation models in metaverse, namely, \u201cSE-enabled foundation models in metaverse.\u201d Particularly, the research framework comprises a six-layer architecture (infrastructure layer, operation layer, knowledge layer, intelligence layer, management layer, and interaction layer), which can provide controllability, trustworthiness, and interactivity for the foundation models in metaverse. This creates closed-loop, virtual\u2013real, and human\u2013machine environments that provides the best indices and goals for the foundation models, which allows us to fully validate and calibrate the corresponding models. Then, examples of use cases from the automotive industry are listed to provide transparency on the possible use and benefits of our approach. Finally, the open research topics of related frameworks are discussed.",

            "abstract": "This letter reports on a TIV DHW (decentralized and hybrid workshop) that explores the prospective influence of ChatGPT on research and development in intelligent vehicles. To assess the update capabilities of ChatGPT, we conducted tests involving both basic and technically relevant questions. Our preliminary testing revealed that ChatGPT's information can be updated and corrected at one time, but it may take some time for the changes to be reflected in ChatGPT's responses, so it may not always possess the latest knowledge regarding specific topics. We further discuss the prospective influence of ChatGPT on the field of intelligent vehicles, particularly possible applications of ChatGPT in areas like autonomous driving, human-vehicle interaction, and intelligent transportation systems, highlighting challenges and opportunities associated with these applications. Additionally, we address technical questions, such as the feasibility of training intelligent vehicles using the same methods as ChatGPT and the reflection of the intelligence of intelligent vehicles in the context of human-machine shared control. In conclusion, this letter presents a preliminary exploration of the potential of ChatGPT for intelligent vehicle research, from an IEEE TIV perspective, acknowledging the limitations and uncertainties of this emerging technology.",
