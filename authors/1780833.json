            "abstract": "Detecting complex behavioral patterns in temporal data, such as moving object trajectories, often relies on precise formal specifications derived from vague domain concepts. However, such methods are sensitive to noise and minor fluctuations, leading to missed pattern occurrences. Conversely, machine learning (ML) approaches require abundant labeled examples, posing practical challenges. Our visual analytics approach enables domain experts to derive, test, and combine interval-based features to discriminate patterns and generate training data for ML algorithms. Visual aids enhance recognition and characterization of expected patterns and discovery of unexpected ones. Case studies demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of the approach, which offers a novel framework for integrating human expertise and analytical reasoning with ML techniques, advancing data analytics.",

With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously.

In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy.

            "abstract": "The term \u2018episode\u2019 refers to a time interval in the development of a dynamic process or behaviour of an entity. Episode\u2010based data consist of a set of episodes that are described using time series of multiple attribute values. Our research problem involves analysing episode\u2010based data in order to understand the distribution of multi\u2010attribute dynamic characteristics across a set of episodes. To solve this problem, we applied an existing theoretical model and developed a general approach that involves incrementally increasing data abstraction. We instantiated this general approach in an analysis procedure in which the value variation of each attribute within an episode is represented by a combination of symbols treated as a \u2018word\u2019. The variation of multiple attributes is thus represented by a combination of \u2018words\u2019 treated as a \u2018text\u2019. In this way, the the set of episodes is transformed to a collection of text documents. Topic modelling techniques applied to this collection find groups of related (i.e. repeatedly co\u2010occurring) \u2018words\u2019, which are called \u2018topics\u2019. Given that the \u2018words\u2019 encode variation patterns of individual attributes, the \u2018topics\u2019 represent patterns of joint variation of multiple attributes. In the following steps, analysts interpret the topics and examine their distribution across all episodes using interactive visualizations. We test the effectiveness of the procedure by applying it to two types of episode\u2010based data with distinct properties and introduce a range of generic and data type\u2010specific visualization techniques that can support the interpretation and exploration of topic distribution.",

Currently, trust in ML applications is an implicit process that takes place in the user\u2019s mind. As such, there is no method of feedback or communication of trust that can be acted upon. Our framework will be instrumental in developing interactive visualization approaches that will help users to efficiently and effectively build and communicate trust in ways that fit each of the ML process stages. We formulate several research questions and directions that include: 1) a typology/taxonomy of trust objects, trust issues, and possible reasons for (mis)trust; 2) formalisms to represent trust in machine-readable form; 3) means by which users can express their state of trust by interacting with a computer system (e.g., text, drawing, marking); 4) ways in which a system can facilitate users\u2019 expression and communication of the state of trust; and 5) creation of visual interactive techniques for representation and exploration of trust over all stages of an ML pipeline.",

For example, train journeys (jobs) consist of moves and stops (operations) to be served by rail tracks and stations (machines). A schedule is an assignment of the job operations to machines and times where and when they will be executed. The developers of computational methods for job scheduling need tools enabling them to explore how their methods work. At a high level of generality, we define the system of pertinent exploration tasks and a combination of visualizations capable of supporting the tasks. We provide general descriptions of the purposes, contents, visual encoding, properties, and interactive facilities of the visualizations and illustrate them with images from an example implementation in air traffic management. We justify the design of the visualizations based on the tasks, principles of creating visualizations for pattern discovery, and scalability requirements. The outcomes of our research are sufficiently general to be of use in a variety of applications.",

We conducted an exploratory empirical study in which participants analysed complex and data\u2010rich visualisations by detecting salient visual patterns, translating them into conceptual information structures and reasoning about those structures to construct an overall understanding of the analysis subject. Eye tracking and voice recording were used to capture this process. We analysed how the data we had collected match several existing theoretical models intended to describe visualisation\u2010supported reasoning, knowledge building, decision making or use and development of mental models. We found that none of these theoretical models alone is sufficient for describing the processes of visual analysis and knowledge generation that we observed in our experiments, whereas a combination of three particular models could be apposite. We also pondered whether empirical studies like ours can be used to derive implications and recommendations for possible ways to support users of visual analytics systems. Our approaches to designing and conducting the experiments and analysing the empirical data were appropriate to the goals of the study and can be recommended for use in other empirical studies in visual analytics.",

A grand challenge is to adapt ML and XAI to human goals, concepts, values, and ways of thinking. Complementing the current efforts in XAI towards solving this challenge, VA can contribute by exploiting the potential of visualization as an effective way of communicating information to humans and a strong trigger of human abstractive perception and thinking.

            "abstract": "Visual analytics usually deals with complex data and uses sophisticated algorithmic, visual, and interactive techniques supporting the analysis. Findings and results of the analysis often need to be communicated to an audience that lacks visual analytics expertise. This requires analysis outcomes to be presented in simpler ways than that are typically used in visual analytics systems. However, not only analytical visualizations may be too complex for target audiences but also the information that needs to be presented. Analysis results may consist of multiple components, which may involve multiple heterogeneous facets. Hence, there exists a gap on the path from obtaining analysis findings to communicating them, within which two main challenges lie: information complexity and display complexity. We address this problem by proposing a general framework where data analysis and result presentation are linked by story synthesis, in which the analyst creates and organises story contents. Unlike previous research, where analytic findings are represented by stored display states, we treat findings as data constructs. We focus on selecting, assembling and organizing findings for further presentation rather than on tracking analysis history and enabling dual (i.e., explorative and communicative) use of data displays. In story synthesis, findings are selected, assembled, and arranged in meaningful layouts that take into account the structure of information and inherent properties of its components. We propose a workflow for applying the proposed conceptual framework in designing visual analytics systems and demonstrate the generality of the approach by applying it to two diverse domains, social media and movement analysis.",
