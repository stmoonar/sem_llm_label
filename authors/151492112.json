            "abstract": "System definitions are artifacts built by humans to depict what a system is. System definition 1.0 defines a system as a dubiously coalesced whole, embodied in its components. System Definition 1.0 possesses a major flaw that lacks the capability of specifying the coalescence of structure and behavior. The structure-behavior coalescence (SBC) approach supports a graceful way to coalesce structure and behavior. Thus by using SBC, system definition 2.0 shall define a system as a truly coalesced whole, embodied in its assembled components. Since system definition 2.0 specifies the coalescence of system structure and system behavior, it can certainly shape a fully coalesced system.",

            "abstract": "Animation education in the new media era is moving toward the goal of cultivating high-end talents. The development of an architecture-oriented animation studies platform provides guarantee for the training of talents in terms of teaching quality. This research uses the Internet as the medium and mobile phones and computer clients as the main technology platforms, starting from the software architecture and constructing the system model of the animation studies platform according to the Structure-Behavior Coalescence (SBC) method. The core theme of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a modeling language with model consistency of systems structure and systems behavior. This paper developed Structure-Behavior Coalescence State Machine (SBC-SM) as the formal language for the MBSE animation studies platform design model singularity. The model consistency will be fully guaranteed in the MBSE animation studies platform design when the SBC state machine approach is adopted. It not only improves the efficiency of platform development but also reduces the difficulty and risk of platform development.",

In this model singularity SBC IBD-AD process algebra, both IBD and AD are its projected views, so the inconsistency between IBD and AD naturally disappears.",

In this paper, we introduce a new approach for general-purpose systems modeling called structure-behavior coalescence (SBC), which supports the integration of modeling both structural and behavioral aspects of a system in a single diagram. Process algebra is utilized to describe the interactions between the components of the system. SBC combines graphical notation and process algebra to provide formalism and an intuitive representation in the development of the conceptual model. The SBC model can clearly describe the interactions between system components and precisely specify the execution order of an entire system via algebraic operations.",
