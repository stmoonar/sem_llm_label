Besides classical crowdsourcing features, Headwork eases the development of crowdsourcing campaigns through a full relational abstraction of relevant concepts (participants, skills, tasks, current answers, decision procedures, GUI, etc.). It allows in particular the orchestration of complex dynamic tasks using so-called tuple artifacts (i",

            "title": "DataTime: a Framework to smoothly Integrate Past, Present and Future into Models",
            "abstract": "Models at runtime have been initially investigated for adaptive systems. Models are used as a reflective layer of the current state of the system to support the implementation of a feedback loop. More recently, models at runtime have also been identified as key for supporting the development of full-fledged digital twins. However, this use of models at runtime raises new challenges, such as the ability to seamlessly interact with the past, present and future states of the system. In this paper, we propose a framework called DataTime to implement models at runtime which capture the state of the system according to the dimensions of both time and space, here modeled as a directed graph where both nodes and edges bear local states (ie. values of properties of interest). DataTime provides a unifying interface to query the past, present and future (predicted) states of the system. This unifying interface provides i) an optimized structure of the time series that capture the past states of the system, possibly evolving over time, ii) the ability to get the last available value provided by the system's sensors, and iii) a continuous micro-learning over graph edges of a predictive model to make it possible to query future states, either locally or more globally, thanks to a composition law. The framework has been developed and evaluated in the context of the Intelligent Public Transportation Systems of the city of Rennes (France). This experimentation has demonstrated how DataTime can deprecate the use of heterogeneous tools for managing data from the past, the present and the future, and facilitate the development of digital twins.",

            "title": "Certifying Numerical Decompositions of Compact Group Representations",
            "abstract": "We present a performant and rigorous algorithm for certifying that a matrix is close to being a projection onto an irreducible subspace of a given group representation. This addresses a problem arising when one seeks solutions to semi-definite programs (SDPs) with a group symmetry. Indeed, in this context, the dimension of the SDP can be significantly reduced if the irreducible representations of the group action are explicitly known. Rigorous numerical algorithms for decomposing a given group representation into irreps are known, but fairly expensive. To avoid this performance problem, existing software packages -- e.g. RepLAB, which motivated the present work -- use randomized heuristics. While these seem to work well in practice, the problem of to which extent the results can be trusted arises. Here, we provide rigorous guarantees applicable to finite and compact groups, as well as a software implementation that can interface with RepLAB. Under natural assumptions, a commonly used previous method due to Babai and Friedl runs in time O(n^5) for n-dimensional representations. In our approach, the complexity of running both the heuristic decomposition and the certification step is O(max{n^3 log n, D d^2 log d}), where d is the maximum dimension of an irreducible subrepresentation, and D is the time required to multiply elements of the group. A reference implementation interfacing with RepLAB is provided.",

            "abstract": "The Gottesman-Knill theorem states that a Clifford circuit acting on stabilizer states can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. Recently, this result has been generalized to cover inputs that are close to a coherent superposition of logarithmically many stabilizer states. The runtime of the classical simulation is governed by the stabilizer extent, which roughly measures how many stabilizer states are needed to approximate the state. An important open problem is to decide whether the extent is multiplicative under tensor products. An affirmative answer would yield an efficient algorithm for computing the extent of product inputs, while a negative result implies the existence of more efficient classical algorithms for simulating largescale quantum circuits. Here, we answer this question in the negative. Our result follows from very general properties of the set of stabilizer states, such as having a size that scales subexponentially in the dimension, and can thus be readily adapted to similar constructions for other resource theories.",

Bringing humans back to the frontier of FoW will increase their trust in AI systems and shift their perception to use them as a source of self-improvement, ensure better work performance, and positively shape social and economic outcomes of a society and a nation. To enable that, physical and virtual workplaces will need to capture human traits, behavior, evolving needs, and provide jobs to all. Attitudes, values, opinions regarding the processes and policies will need to be assessed and considered in the design of FoW ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Investigating the classical simulability of quantum circuits provides a promising avenue towards understanding the computational power of quantum systems. Whether a class of quantum circuits can be efficiently simulated with a probabilistic classical computer, or is provably hard to simulate, depends quite critically on the precise notion of ``classical simulation'' and in particular on the required accuracy. We argue that a notion of classical simulation, which we call EPSILON-simulation (or \u03f5-simulation for short), captures the essence of possessing ``equivalent computational power'' as the quantum system it simulates: It is statistically impossible to distinguish an agent with access to an \u03f5-simulator from one possessing the simulated quantum system. We relate \u03f5-simulation to various alternative notions of simulation predominantly focusing on a simulator we call a poly-box. A poly-box outputs 1/poly precision additive estimates of Born probabilities and marginals. This notion of simulation has gained prominence through a number of recent simulability results. Accepting some plausible computational theoretic assumptions, we show that \u03f5-simulation is strictly stronger than a poly-box by showing that IQP circuits and unconditioned magic-state injected Clifford circuits are both hard to \u03f5-simulate and yet admit a poly-box. In contrast, we also show that these two notions are equivalent under an additional assumption on the sparsity of the output distribution (poly-sparsity).",

            "title": "PEPS: a platform for supporting studies in pharmaco-epidemiology using medico-administrative databases",
            "abstract": "Background: \nNew approaches of pharmaco-epidemiology consist in using large EHR databases to investigate the effects and uses (or misuses) of drugs in real conditions. The objective is to benefit from nationwide available data to answer accurately and in a short time pharmaco-epidemiological queries for national public health institutions. Despite the potential availability of the data, their size and complexity make their analysis long and tremendous. The challenge we tackle is the conception of a generic digital toolbox to support the efficient design of a broad range of pharmaco-epidemiology studies from EHR databases. \n \nMethods: \nTo be able to answer the broad range of pharmaco-epidemiological queries from national public health institutions, the PEPS platform exploits, in secondary use, the French health cross-schemes insurance system, called SNIIRAM. The SNIIRAM covers most of the French population with a sliding period of 3 past years. To tackle the volume and the diversity of the SNIIRAM data warehouse, a research program has been established to design an innovative toolbox. This research program is focused first on the modeling of care pathways from the SNIIRAM database and, second, on the design of tools supporting meaningful insights extraction about massive and complex care pathways by clinicians. \n \nResults: \nA data infrastructure has been set up to collect and to access the data securely. We proposed and developed a high level abstraction model to access and to visualize care pathways. We designed the principle of a toolbox to carry out generic pharmaco-epidemiological studies from the SNIIRAM data warehouse (see figure). This toolbox is oriented toward data analytics with data visualisation, domain specific query language, knowledge discovery and statistics modules. \n \nConclusions: \nThe preliminary results on the development of the PEPS platform show that our care pathways model is very expressive and that it allows to have a highly abstracted representation of the warehouse's complex data. Our modular architecture supports clinicians and epidemiologists all along their analysis process.",

            "abstract": "Besides the simple human intelligence tasks such as image labeling, crowdsourcing platforms propose more and more tasks that require very specific skills, especially in participative science projects. In this context, there is a need to reason about the required skills for a task and the set of available skills in the crowd, in order to increase the resulting quality. Most of the existing solutions rely on unstructured tags to model skills (vector of skills). In this paper we propose to finely model tasks and participants using a skill tree, that is a taxonomy of skills equipped with a similarity distance within skills. This model of skills enables to map participants to tasks in a way that exploits the natural hierarchy among the skills. We illustrate the effectiveness of our model and algorithms through extensive experimentation with synthetic and real data sets.",
