            "abstract": "We demonstrate the Patterns of Life Simulation to create realistic simulations of human mobility in a city. This simulation has recently been used to generate massive amounts of trajectory and check-in data. Our demonstration focuses on using the simulation twofold: (1) using the graphical user interface (GUI), and (2) running the simulation headless by disabling the GUI for faster data generation. We further demonstrate how the Patterns of Life simulation can be used to simulate any region on Earth by using publicly available data from OpenStreetMap. Finally, we also demonstrate recent improvements to the scalability of the simulation allows simulating up to 100,000 individual agents for years of simulation time. During our demonstration, as well as offline using our guides on GitHub, participants will learn: (1) The theories of human behavior driving the Patters of Life simulation, (2) how to simulate to generate massive amounts of synthetic yet realistic trajectory data, (3) running the simulation for a region of interest chosen by participants using OSM data, (4) learn the scalability of the simulation and understand the properties of generated data, and (5) manage thousands of parallel simulation instances running concurrently.",

            "abstract": "Semantic trajectories, which enrich spatial-temporal data with textual information such as trip purposes or location activities, are key for identifying outlier behaviors critical to healthcare, social security, and urban planning. Traditional outlier detection relies on heuristic rules, which requires domain knowledge and limits its ability to identify unseen outliers. Besides, there lacks a comprehensive approach that can jointly consider multi-modal data across spatial, temporal, and textual dimensions. Addressing the need for a domain-agnostic model, we propose the Transferable Outlier Detection for Human Semantic Trajectories (TOD4Traj) framework.TOD4Traj first introduces a modality feature unification module to align diverse data feature representations, enabling the integration of multi-modal information and enhancing transferability across different datasets. A contrastive learning module is further pro-posed for identifying regular mobility patterns both temporally and across populations, allowing for a joint detection of outliers based on individual consistency and group majority patterns. Our experimental results have shown TOD4Traj's superior performance over existing models, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in detecting human trajectory outliers across various datasets.",

            "abstract": "Historically, much of the research in understanding, modeling, and mining human trajectory data has focused on where an individual stays. Thus, the focus of existing research has been on where a user goes. On the other hand, the study of how a user moves between locations has great potential for new research opportunities. Kinematic features describe how an individual moves between locations and can be used for tasks such as identification of individuals or anomaly detection. Unfortunately, data availability and quality challenges make kinematic trajectory mining difficult. In this paper, we leverage the Geolife dataset of human trajectories to investigate the viability of using kinematic features to identify individuals and detect anomalies. We show that humans have an individual\"kinematic profile\"which can be used as a strong signal to identify individual humans. We experimentally show that, for the two use-cases of individual identification and anomaly detection, simple kinematic features fed to standard classification and anomaly detection algorithms significantly improve results.",

            "title": "Urban Anomalies: A Simulated Human Mobility Dataset with Injected Anomalies",
            "abstract": "Human mobility anomaly detection based on location is essential in areas such as public health, safety, welfare, and urban planning. Developing models and approaches for location-based anomaly detection requires a comprehensive dataset. However, privacy concerns and the absence of ground truth hinder the availability of publicly available datasets. With this paper, we provide extensive simulated human mobility datasets featuring various anomaly types created using an existing Urban Patterns of Life Simulation. To create these datasets, we inject changes in the logic of individual agents to change their behavior. Specifically, we create four of anomalous agent behavior by (1) changing the agents' appetite (causing agents to have meals more frequently), (2) changing their group of interest (causing agents to interact with different agents from another group). (3) changing their social place selection (causing agents to visit different recreational places) and (4) changing their work schedule (causing agents to skip work), For each type of anomaly, we use three degrees of behavioral change to tune the difficulty of detecting the anomalous agents. To select agents to inject anomalous behavior into, we employ three methods: (1) Random selection using a centralized manipulation mechanism, (2) Spread based selection using an infectious disease model, and (3) through exposure of agents to a specific location. All datasets are split into normal and anomalous phases. The normal phase, which can be used for training models of normalcy, exhibits no anomalous behavior. The anomalous phase, which can be used for testing for anomalous detection algorithm, includes ground truth labels that indicate, for each five-minute simulation step, which agents are anomalous at that time. Datasets are generated using the maps (roads and buildings) for Atlanta and Berlin, having 1k agents in each simulation.",

            "abstract": "Human trajectory anomaly detection has become increasingly important across a wide range of applications, including security surveillance and public health. However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.",

With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously.

In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Shortest path computation is a fundamental operation in many application domains and is especially challenging in frequently evolving small-world networks (i.e., graphs in which many nodes can be reached from every other node by a small number of hops). Index-based methods, especially ones based on 2-hop labeling are often used for high query efficiency. However, the evolvements of small-world networks in many realistic scenarios pose the challenge of efficient maintenance of the shortest path index. In this work, we adopt the state-of-the-art Parallel Shortest-distance Labeling (PSL) as the underlying 2-hop labeling construction method, and design algorithms to support its efficient update given edge weight changes (increase and decrease). Specifically, we focus on weighted PSL (WPSL) and propose a propagation-based update mechanism for both synchronous and asynchronous propagation. We also identify the curse of pruning power in the edge weight increase case, and solve it with a balance between index size and effectiveness. Followed by, we extend the asynchronous propagation method to Pruned Landmark Labeling (PLL) for faster index maintenance and query processing with a smaller index size. Finally, we further optimize the index performance by reducing the index size through graph contraction and accelerating the index update through parallelized mix index update. Our experimental results on real-life and synthetic networks demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the relevant baselines on index maintenance.",

            "abstract": "Individual human location trajectory and check-in data have been the driving force for human mobility research in recent years. However, existing human mobility datasets are very limited in size and representativeness. For example, one of the largest and most commonly used datasets of individual human location trajectories, GeoLife, captures fewer than two hundred individuals. To help fill this gap, this Data and Resources paper leverages an existing data generator based on fine-grained simulation of individual human patterns of life to produce large-scale trajectory, check-in, and social network data. In this simulation, individual human agents commute between their home and work locations, visit restaurants to eat, and visit recreational sites to meet friends. We provide large datasets of months of simulated trajectories for two example regions in the United States: San Francisco and New Orleans. In addition to making the datasets available, we also provide instructions on how the simulation can be used to re-generate data, thus allowing researchers to generate the data locally without downloading prohibitively large files.",

            "abstract": "Multiresolution deep learning approaches, such as the UNet architecture, have achieved high performance in classifying and segmenting images. Most traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures commonly use pooling to enlarge the receptive field, which usually results in irreversible information loss. The UNet architecture avoids this information loss by introducing skip connections that allow the reconstruction of lost information. Leveraging this property of the UNet, this study proposes to include a Riesz-Quincunx (RQ) wavelet transform, which combines: 1) higher order Riesz wavelet transform and 2) orthogonal Quincunx wavelets (commonly used to reduce blur in medical images) inside the UNet to reduce noise in satellite images and their time-series. Combining both approaches, we introduce a hybrid RQ-UNet variational autoencoder (RQUNet-VAE) scheme for image and time series decomposition used to reduce noise in satellite imagery. By including denoising capabilities directly inside the UNet architecture, we hypothesize that our RQUNet-VAE may improve downstream image processing tasks that use the traditional UNet architecture. We present qualitative and quantitative experimental results that demonstrate that our proposed RQUNet-VAE is effective at reducing noise in satellite imagery yielding results similar to other state-of-the-art noise reduction methods. We further show that our RQUNet-VAE outperforms the UNet architecture specifically in cases where images exhibit high levels of noise. We show this result in two down-stream applications for multiband satellite images, including image time-series decomposition and image segmentation.",

            "abstract": "Urban areas provide us with a treasure trove of available data capturing almost every aspect of a population's life. This work focuses on mobility data and how it will help improve our understanding of urban mobility patterns. Readily available and sizable farecard data captures trips in a public transportation network. However, such data typically lacks temporal signatures and as such the task of inferring trip semantics, station function, and user clustering is quite challenging. While existing approaches either focus on station-level or user-level signals only, we propose a Station-to-User (S2U) transfer learning framework, which augments user-level learning with shared temporal patterns learned from station-level signals. Our framework is based on a novel, so-called \"Tidal-Regularized Non-negative Matrix Factorization\" method, which incorporates a-priori tidal traffic patterns in generic Non-negative Matrix Factorization. To evaluate our model performance, a user clustering stability test based on the classical Rand Index is introduced as a metric to benchmark different unsupervised learning models. Using this metric, quantitative evaluations on three real-world datasets show that S2U outperforms two baselines methods by 7-21%. We also provide a qualitative analysis of the user clustering and station functions for the Washington D.C. metro and show how S2U can support spatiotemporal urban analytics.",
