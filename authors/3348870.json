            "abstract": "Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of ecology and conservation. Pairing species observations with geographic and environmental predictors allows us to model the relationship between an environment and the species present at a given location. In light of that, we organize an annual competition, GeoLifeCLEF, which focuses on benchmarking and advancing state-of-the-art species distribution modeling using available bioclimatic and remote sensing data. The GeoLifeCLEF 2024 dataset spans across Europe and encompasses most of its flora. The species observation data comprises over 5 million Presence-Only (PO) occurrences and approximately 90 thousand Presence-Absence (PA) surveys. Those data are paired with various high-resolution rasters, including remote sensing imagery, land cover, and elevation, and are combined with coarse-resolution data such as climate, soil, and human footprint variables. In this paper, we present (i) an overview of the GeoLifeCLEF 2024 competition, (ii) a description of the provided data, (iii) an overview of approaches used by the participating teams, and (iv) the main results analysis.",

            "abstract": "The post-2020 global biodiversity framework needs ambitious, research-based targets. Estimating the accelerated extinction risk due to climate change is critical. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) measures the extinction risk of species. Automatic methods have been developed to provide information on the IUCN status of under-assessed taxa. However, these compensatory methods are based on current species characteristics, mainly geographical, which precludes their use in future projections. Here, we evaluate a novel method for classifying the IUCN status of species benefiting from the generalisation power of species distribution models based on deep learning. Our method matches state-of-the-art classification performance while relying on flexible SDM-based features that capture species' environmental preferences. Cross-validation yields average accuracies of 0.61 for status classification and 0.78 for binary classification. Climate change will reshape future species distributions. Under the species-environment equilibrium hypothesis, SDM projections approximate plausible future outcomes. Two extremes of species dispersal capacity are considered: unlimited or null. The projected species distributions are translated into features feeding our IUCN classification method. Finally, trends in threatened species are analysed over time and i) by continent and as a function of average ii) latitude or iii) altitude. The proportion of threatened species is increasing globally, with critical rates in Africa, Asia and South America. Furthermore, the proportion of threatened species is predicted to peak around the two Tropics, at the Equator, in the lowlands and at altitudes of 800-1,500 m.",

The framework is open-sourced on GitHub and PyPi along with extensive documentation and examples of use in various scenarios. MALPOLON offers straightforward installation, YAML-based configuration, parallel computing, multi-GPU utilization, baseline and foundational models for benchmarking, and extensive tutorials/documentation, aiming to enhance accessibility and performance scalability for ecologists and researchers.",

            "abstract": "The difficulty of monitoring biodiversity at fine scales and over large areas limits ecological knowledge and conservation efforts. To fill this gap, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) predict species across space from spatially explicit features. Yet, they face the challenge of integrating the rich but heterogeneous data made available over the past decade, notably millions of opportunistic species observations and standardized surveys, as well as multi-modal remote sensing data. In light of that, we have designed and developed a new European-scale dataset for SDMs at high spatial resolution (10-50 m), including more than 10k species (i.e., most of the European flora). The dataset comprises 5M heterogeneous Presence-Only records and 90k exhaustive Presence-Absence survey records, all accompanied by diverse environmental rasters (e.g., elevation, human footprint, and soil) that are traditionally used in SDMs. In addition, it provides Sentinel-2 RGB and NIR satellite images with 10 m resolution, a 20-year time-series of climatic variables, and satellite time-series from the Landsat program. In addition to the data, we provide an openly accessible SDM benchmark (hosted on Kaggle), which has already attracted an active community and a set of strong baselines for single predictor/modality and multimodal approaches. All resources, e.g., the dataset, pre-trained models, and baseline methods (in the form of notebooks), are available on Kaggle, allowing one to start with our dataset literally with two mouse clicks.",

            "abstract": "Although increasing threats on biodiversity are now widely recognised, there are no accurate global maps showing whether and where species assemblages are at risk. We hereby assess and map at kilometre resolution the conservation status of the iconic orchid family, and discuss the insights conveyed at multiple scales. We introduce a new Deep Species Distribution Model trained on 1M occurrences of 14K orchid species to predict their assemblages at global scale and at kilometre resolution. We propose two main indicators of the conservation status of the assemblages: (i) the proportion of threatened species, and (ii) the status of the most threatened species in the assemblage. We show and analyze the variation of these indicators at World scale and in relation to currently protected areas in Sumatra island. Global and interactive maps available online show the indicators of conservation status of orchid assemblages, with sharp spatial variations at all scales. The highest level of threat is found at Madagascar and the neighbouring islands. In Sumatra, we found good correspondence of protected areas with our indicators, but supplementing current IUCN assessments with status predictions results in alarming levels of species threat across the island. Recent advances in deep learning enable reliable mapping of the conservation status of species assemblages on a global scale. As an umbrella taxon, orchid family provides a reference for identifying vulnerable ecosystems worldwide, and prioritising conservation actions both at international and local levels.",

            "abstract": "Average-K classification is an alternative to top-K classification in which the number of labels returned varies with the ambiguity of the input image but must average to K over all the samples. A simple method to solve this task is to threshold the softmax output of a model trained with the cross-entropy loss. This approach is theoretically proven to be asymptotically consistent, but it is not guaranteed to be optimal for a finite set of samples. In this paper, we propose a new loss function based on a multi-label classification head in addition to the classical softmax. This second head is trained using pseudo-labels generated by thresholding the softmax head while guaranteeing that K classes are returned on average. We show that this approach allows the model to better capture ambiguities between classes and, as a result, to return more consistent sets of possible classes. Experiments on two datasets from the literature demonstrate that our approach outperforms the softmax baseline, as well as several other loss functions more generally designed for weakly supervised multi-label classification. The gains are larger the higher the uncertainty, especially for classes with few samples.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023. The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation, in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition, synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation, and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label data in training.",

            "abstract": "Mental and physical health are strongly linked in a bidirectional relationship. Due to the stigma, ignorance, prejudice, fear, and many other reasons, there exists a large universal treatment gap for people with mental disorders. This could motivate those at-risk individuals to find their way into social networks, asking for information or emotional support. Language could provide a natural eyepiece for the study and detection of such at-risk individuals through their writings on social media platforms. In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting at-risk users with clear signs of depression, anorexia, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. We introduce NCNL, a novel deep learning ensemble architecture that makes use of multiple noisy base learners in Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) configuration for text classification. NCNL is designed to be, backbone-independent, and we examine it with modern Transformer-based architectures. We evaluate our models on six different tasks for at-risk user detection and classification. Our models achieve significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art results reported for five out of the six tasks. Extensive experiments show how NCNL improves diversity over the classical conventional ensemble and the effect of using noisy base learners.",

Research on controversy led to two main categories of works: controversy detection/quantification and controversy explainability. When the former aims to quantify controversy on a topic, the latter aims to understand why a topic is controversial or not. This paper mainly contributes to the controversy explainability. We analyze topic discussions on Twitter from the community perspective to investigate the power of text in classifying tweets into the right community. We propose a SHAP-based pipeline to quantify impactful text features on predictions of three tweet classifiers. We also rely on the use of different text features namely BERT, TF \u2212 IDF, and LIWC. The results we obtain from both SHAP plots and statistical analysis show clearly significant impacts of some text features in classifying tweets.It also highlights the relevance of the study as well as the potential benefits of combining text and user interactions to quantify controversy.",

In this article, we focus on binary text classification via NNs and propose a new tool, which includes a visualization of the decision boundary and the distances of data elements to this boundary. This tool increases the interpretability of NN. Our approach uses two innovative views: (1) an overview of the text representation space and (2) a local view allowing data exploration around the decision boundary for various localities of this representation space. These views are integrated into a visual platform, EBBE-Text, which also contains state-of-the-art visualizations of NN representation spaces and several kinds of information obtained from the classification process. The various views are linked through numerous interactive functionalities that enable easy exploration of texts and classification results via the various complementary views. A user study shows the effectiveness of the visual encoding and a case study illustrates the benefits of using our tool for the analysis of the classifications obtained with several recent NNs and two datasets.",

As the number of classes increases, class ambiguity and class imbalance become more and more problematic to achieve high top-1 accuracy. Meanwhile, Top-K metrics (metrics allowing K guesses) have become popular, especially for performance reporting. Yet, proposing top-K losses tailored for deep learning remains a challenge, both theoretically and practically. In this paper we introduce a stochastic top-K hinge loss inspired by recent developments on top-K calibrated losses. Our proposal is based on the smoothing of the top-K operator building on the flexible\"perturbed optimizer\"framework. We show that our loss function performs very well in the case of balanced datasets, while benefiting from a significantly lower computational time than the state-of-the-art top-K loss function. In addition, we propose a simple variant of our loss for the imbalanced case. Experiments on a heavy-tailed dataset show that our loss function significantly outperforms other baseline loss functions.",

By pairing species occurrences with environmental features, researchers can model the relationship between an environment and the species which may be found there. To advance research in this area, a large-scale machine learning competition called GeoLifeCLEF 2022 was organized. It relied on a dataset of 1.6 million observations from 17K species of animals and plants. These observations were paired with high-resolution remote sensing imagery, land cover data, and altitude, in addition to traditional low-resolution climate and soil variables. The main goal of the challenge was to better understand how to leverage remote sensing data to predict the presence of species at a given location. This paper presents an overview of the competition, synthesizes the approaches used by the participating groups, and analyzes the main results. In particular, we highlight the ability of remote sensing imagery and convolutional neural networks to improve predictive performance, complementary to traditional approaches.",

Beyond GPS coordinates, additional covariates are provided for each observation: remote sensing imagery, land cover data, altitude data, bioclimatic data and pedologic data. We tested two simple approaches making use of every covariate available: (i) training separate models from them, testing them separately, and, (ii) combining those models together in the simplest manner, i.e., averaging their predicted scores. These simple methods allowed us to reach the fourth position on the private leaderboard of the competition.

            "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are statistical models suited for learning complex visual patterns. In the context of Species Distribution Models (SDM) and in line with predictions of landscape ecology and island biogeography, CNN could grasp how local landscape structure affects prediction of species occurrence in SDMs. The prediction can thus reflect the signatures of entangled ecological processes. Although previous machine-learning based SDMs can learn complex influences of environmental predictors, they cannot acknowledge the influence of environmental structure in local landscapes (hence denoted \u201cpunctual models\u201d). In this study, we applied CNNs to a large dataset of plant occurrences in France (GBIF), on a large taxonomical scale, to predict ranked relative probability of species (by joint learning) to any geographical position. We examined the way local environmental landscapes improve prediction by performing alternative CNN models deprived of information on landscape heterogeneity and structure (\u201cablation experiments\u201d). We found that the landscape structure around location crucially contributed to improve predictive performance of CNN-SDMs. CNN models can classify the predicted distributions of many species, as other joint modelling approaches, but they further prove efficient in identifying the influence of local environmental landscapes. CNN can then represent signatures of spatially structured environmental drivers. The prediction gain is noticeable for rare species, which open promising perspectives for biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies. Therefore, the approach is of both theoretical and practical interest. We discuss the way to test hypotheses on the patterns learnt by CNN, which should be essential for further interpretation of the ecological processes at play.",

Two tasks (T1 and T2) focus on early risk detection of signs of anorexia and self-harm respectively. The other one (T3) focus on estimation of the severity level of depression from a thread of user submissions. In this paper, we present the participation of LIRMM (Laboratoire d\u2019Informatique, de Robotique et de Micro\u00b4electronique de Montpellier) in both tasks on early detection (T1 and T2). The proposed model addresses this problem by modeling the temporal mood variation detected from user posts through multi-stage learning phases. The proposed architectures use only textual information without any hand-crafted features or dictionaries. The basic architecture uses two learning phases through exploration of state-of-the-art deep language models. The proposed models perform comparably to other contributions.",

            "abstract": "This technical report describes the model that achieved the best performance of the GeoLifeCLEF challenge, the objective of which was to evaluate methods for plant species prediction based on their geographical location. Our method is based on an adaptation of the Inception v3 architecture initially dedicated to the classification of RGB images. We modified the input layer of this architecture so as to process the spatialized environmental tensors as images with 77 distinct channels. Using this architecture, we did train several models that mainly differed in the used training data and in the predicted output classes. One of the main objective, in particular, was to compare the performance of a model trained with plant occurrences only to that obtained with a model trained on all available occurrences, including the species of other kingdoms. Our results show that the global model performs consistently better than the plant-specific model. This suggests that the convolutional neural network is able to capture some inter-dependencies among all species and that this information significantly improves the generalisation capacity of the model for any species.",

            "abstract": "Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most commonly used recommendation methods. CF consists in predicting whether, or how much, a user will like (or dislike) an item by leveraging the knowledge of the user's preferences as well as that of other users. In practice, users interact and express their opinion on only a small subset of items, which makes the corresponding user-item rating matrix very sparse. Such data sparsity yields two main problems for recommender systems: (1) the lack of data to effectively model users' preferences, and (2) the lack of data to effectively model item characteristics. However, there are often many other data sources that are available to a recommender system provider, which can describe user interests and item characteristics (e.g., users' social network, tags associated to items, etc.). These valuable data sources may supply useful information to enhance a recommendation system in modeling users' preferences and item characteristics more accurately and thus, hopefully, to make recommenders more precise. For various reasons, these data sources may be managed by clusters of different data centers, thus requiring the development of distributed solutions. In this paper, we propose a new distributed collaborative filtering algorithm, which exploits and combines multiple and diverse data sources to improve recommendation quality. Our experimental evaluation using real datasets shows the effectiveness of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.",

We have developed three kinds of prediction models, one convolutional neural network on environmental data (CNN), one neural network on co-occurrences data and two other models only based on the spatial occurrences of species (a closest-location classifier and a random forest fitted on the spatial coordinates). We also evaluated the combination of these models through two different late fusion methods (one based on predictive probabilities and the other one based on predictive ranks). Results show the effectiveness of the CNN which obtained the best prediction score of the whole GeoLifeCLEF challenge. The fusion of this model with the spatial ones only provides slight improvements suggesting that the CNN already captured most of the spatial information in addition to the environmental preferences of the plants.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale annotated corpora have yielded impressive performance improvements in computer vision and multimedia content analysis. However, such datasets depend on an enormous amount of human labeling effort. When the labels correspond to well-known concepts, it is straightforward to train the annotators by giving a few examples with known answers. It is also straightforward to judge the quality of their labels. Neither is true when there are thousands of complex domain-specific labels. Training on all labels is infeasible and the quality of an annotator's judgements may be vastly different for some subsets of labels than for others. This paper proposes a set of data-driven algorithms to 1) train image annotators on how to disambiguate among automatically generated candidate labels, 2) evaluate the quality of annotators\u2019 label suggestions, and 3) weigh predictions. The algorithms adapt to the skills of each annotator both in the questions asked and the weights given to their answers. The underlying judgements are Bayesian, based on adaptive priors. We measure the benefits of these algorithms on a live user experiment related to image-based plant identification involving around 1000 people. The proposed methods are shown to enable huge gains in annotation accuracy. A standard user can correctly label around <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2\\%$ </tex-math></inline-formula> of our data. This goes up to <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$80\\%$</tex-math> </inline-formula> with machine learning assisted training and assignment and up to almost <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$90\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> when doing a weighted combination of several annotators\u2019 labels.",

Each plant observation contained several annotated pictures with organ/view tags: Flower, Leaf, Fruit, Stem, Branch, Entire, Scan (exclusively of leaf). To address this challenge, we experimented two popular families of classification techniques, i.e. convolutional neural networks (CNN) on one side and fisher vectors-based discriminant models on the other side. Our results show that the CNN approach achieves much better performance than the fisher vectors. Beyond, we show that the fusion of both techniques, based on a Bayesian inference using the confusion matrix of each classifier, did not improve the results of the CNN alone.",

            "abstract": "La recommandation est devenue un mecanisme pour populaire afin d'aider les utilisateurs a retrouver des donnees pertinentes a grande echelle (e.g. donnees scientifiques, Web). De plus, differentes techniques de diversifications ont ete proposees afin d'eviter les redondances des resultats dans le processus de recommandation. Intuitivement, l'objectif de cette diversification est de retourner a l'utilisateur une liste d'elements qui sont a la fois dissimilaires, mais egalement pertinents etant donnes les interets de l'utilisateur. Dans la premiere partie de cette these, l'objectif principal a ete de definir une nouvelle solution de recherche et de recommandation diversifiee adaptee aux donnees scientifiques (i.e. donnees de phenotypage, donnees de botanique). Nous avons ainsi propose, dans un premier temps, la notion de diversification des profils qui permet de resoudre le probleme consistant a retourner des objets (i.e. items) trop redondants, et ameliore la qualite de la diversification par rapport a l'etat de l'art. Nous pensons que ce travail est le premier a aborder la diversite des profils pour eviter d'avoir des objets tres pertinents mais egalement trop specialises. Au travers d'une evaluation experimentale via deux jeux de donnees, nous avons montre que notre fonction de score presente le meilleur compromis entre diversite et pertinence. Afin de mettre en \u0153uvre notre nouvelle fonction de score, nous avons propose un algorithme Top-k base sur un seuil qui exploite la notion de liste de candidats afin de calculer la diversification. Cependant, cet algorithme est gourmand et ne s'adapte pas bien a l'echelle. Pour cela, nous avons egalement propose plusieurs techniques d'optimisation afin d'ameliorer les performances. Tout d'abord, nous avons simplifie le modele de score pour reduire sa complexite de calcul. Deuxiemement, nous avons propose deux techniques pour reduire le nombre d'elements dans la liste de candidats, et donc, le nombre de score diversifies a calculer. Enfin, nous avons propose differents scores d'indexation (i.e. le score utilise pour trier les elements dans les listes inversees) qui prennent en compte la diversification des objets, scores que nous avons utilises pour developper une approche d'indexation adaptative utile afin de limiter le nombre d'acces dans les index et basee sur l'ensemble des requetes soumises au systeme (i.e. queries workload). Nous avons evalue la performance de nos techniques de maniere experimentale. Les resultats montrent que nos optimisations peuvent reduire le temps de reponse jusqu'a un facteur 12 par rapport a un algorithme de diversification basique. Dans la deuxieme partie de la these, nous avons aborde le probleme de la recommandation distribuee et diversifiee (P2P et multi-site) qui s'adapte tres bien a nos differents scenarios d'application. Nous avons propose une nouvelle fonction de score (usefulness ou utilite) permettant de regrouper les utilisateurs pertinents presents dans le recouvrement distribue. Nous avons analyse le nouvel algorithme de regroupement correspondant en detail, et nous avons etudie son comportement avec une evaluation experimentale utilisant differents jeux de donnees. Par rapport a l'etat des solutions de l'art, nous obtenons des gains importants en termes de rappel (ordre de 3 fois).",

            "abstract": "We investigate profile diversity, a novel idea in searching scientic documents. Combining keyword relevance with popularity in a scoring function has been the subject of different forms of social relevance [2, 6, 9]. Content diversity has been thoroughly studied in search and advertising [4, 11], database queries [16, 5, 8], and recommendations [17, 10, 18]. We believe our work is the first to investigate profile diversity to address the problem of returning highly popular but too-focused documents. We show how to adapt Fagin's threshold-based algorithms to return the most relevant and most popular documents that satisfy content and profile diversities and run preliminary experiments on two benchmarks to validate our scoring function.",
