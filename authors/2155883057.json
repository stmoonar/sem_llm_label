            "title": "Personal Data for Personal Use: Vision or Reality?",
            "abstract": "The vision of collecting all of one's personal information into one searchable database has been around at least since Vannevar Bush's 1945 paper on the Memex System [2]. In the late 1990's, Gordon Bell and his colleagues at Microsoft Research built MyLifeBits [1, 6], which was the first serious attempt to build such a database. Since then, there has been continued interest in our community to build personal information management systems [3-5, 7, 8, 10]. Recently, the Solid Project proposes a more radical approach to personal information, arguing that all of one's data should reside in their own data pod, and applications should be redesigned to fetch data from the pod [9].",

            "abstract": "Learning on graphs (LOG) plays a pivotal role in various high-impact application domains. The past decades have developed tremendous theories, algorithms, and open-source systems in answering what/who questions on graphs. However, recent studies reveal that the state-of-the-art techniques for learning on graphs (LOG) are often not trustworthy in practice with respect to several social aspects (e.g., fairness, transparency, security). A natural research question to ask is: how can we make learning algorithms on graphs trustworthy? To answer this question, we propose a paradigm shift, from answering what and who LOG questions to understanding how and why LOG questions. The TrustLOG workshop provides a venue for presenting, discussing, and promoting frontier research on trustworthy learning on graphs. Moreover, TrustLOG will serve as an impulse for the LOG community to identify novel research problems and shed new light on future directions.",

            "title": "MEC-Enabled Hierarchical Emotion Recognition and Perturbation-Aware Defense in Smart Cities",
            "abstract": "With the explosive growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and various emerging network technologies, IoT-enabled smart cities are further refined into health smart cities. For example, IoT devices can automatically recognize emotional states through collected facial expressions, which can further serve mental health assessment, human\u2013computer interaction, etc. On the other hand, existing facial expression recognition algorithms emphasize the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), and it is difficult for resource-constrained IoT devices to provide sufficient computing resources to optimize parameters for DNN-based structures. To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation. This can promote the deployment of our proposed MEC-enabled hierarchical emotion recognition system and defense mechanism in real-world scenarios.",
