            "abstract": "Our project has a very simple aim which is to solve our daily problems which include transferring photos and different media from our phone storage to external storage. which is why we chose to work on - \"transferring phone gallary data to the cloud to reduce load on device's memory\". They are nice portable devices used for communicating but with advancement in phone technology things have taken a turn since we first used a Nokia back in 2001. People communicate and share content with each other via phones .now where does this content go ? right, in our phone's memory but what happens when you run out of space ? right, you use an external memory facility but what's next when the card is full and you don't have the luxury of a laptop around you and you just can't delete all the data you have in the name of memories . I am so glad to tell you that we have a solution .you don't need to worry about the space that is taken by your media. We intend to link this data sends to the cloud .",
