            "abstract": "Complex relationships among entities can be modeled very effectively using hypergraphs. Hypergraphs model real-world data by allowing a hyperedge to include two or more entities. Clustering of hypergraphs enables us to group the similar entities together. While most existing algorithms solely consider the connection structure of a hypergraph to solve the clustering problem, we can boost the clustering performance by considering various features associated with the entities as well as auxiliary relationships among the entities. Also, we can further improve the clustering performance if some of the labels are known and we incorporate them into a clustering model. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised clustering framework for hypergraphs that is able to easily incorporate not only multiple relationships among the entities but also multiple attributes and content of the entities from diverse sources. Furthermore, by showing the close relationship between the hypergraph normalized cut and the weighted kernel K-Means, we also develop an efficient multilevel hypergraph clustering method which provides a good initialization with our semi-supervised multi-view clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm is effective in detecting the ground-truth clusters and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Kernel methods are powerful tools for modeling nonlinear data. However, the amount of computation and memory required for kernel methods becomes the bottleneck when dealing with large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose Nested Nystr\u00f6m Method (NNM) which achieves a delicate balance between the approximation accuracy and computational efficiency by exploiting the multilayer structure and multiple compressions. Even when the size of the kernel matrix is very large, NNM consistently decomposes very small matrices to update the eigen-decomposition of the kernel matrix. We theoretically show that NNM implicitly updates the principal subspace through the multiple layers, and also prove that its corresponding errors of rank-k PSD matrix approximation and kernel PCA (KPCA) are decreased by using additional sublayers before the final layer. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the decreasing property of errors of NNM with the additional sublayers through the experiments on the constructed kernel matrices of real data sets, and show that NNM effectively controls the efficiency both for rank-k PSD matrix approximation and KPCA.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Co-clustering computes clusters of data items and the related features concurrently, and it has been used in many applications such as community detection, product recommendation, computer vision, and pricing optimization. In this paper, we propose a new co-clustering method, called CoDiNMF, which improves the clustering quality and finds directional patterns among co-clusters by using multiple directed and undirected graphs. We design the objective function of co-clustering by using min-cut criterion combined with an additional term which controls the sum of net directional flow between different co-clusters. In addition, we show that a variant of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) can solve the proposed objective function effectively. We run experiments on the US patents and BlogCatalog data sets whose ground truth have been known, and show that CoDiNMF improves clustering results compared to other co-clustering methods in terms of average F1 score, Rand index, and adjusted Rand index (ARI). Finally, we compare CoDiNMF and other co-clustering methods on the Wikipedia data set of philosophers, and we can find meaningful directional flow of influence among co-clusters of philosophers.\n \n",

Opinion mining from social media can be a faster and less expensive alternative to traditional survey and polling, on which many sustainability research are based.

We also propose some possible research directions for tackling these challenges.",
