            "title": "Uncertainty-Aware Ship Location Estimation using Multiple Cameras in Coastal Areas",
            "abstract": "Recent advances, especially in deep learning, allow to effectively detect ship targets in surveillance videos. However, the translation of these detections to the real-world locations of ships has not been sufficiently explored. The common approach in the literature is using a transformation matrix to convert a pixel to a real-world coordinate. However, this approach has three shortcomings: first, a set of reference point pairs has to be manually prepared to establish the matrix; second, the matrix always maps a pixel to the same real-world coordinate, ignoring that there is no one-to-one correspondence between discrete pixel coordinates and continuous real-world coordinates; third, this approach can only work with one camera. In light of this, we propose a technique PixelToRegion that explicitly takes into account the uncertainty in coordinate conversion by mapping each pixel to a spatial polygon. Next, we propose a new algorithm MCbSLE that can estimate ship locations using pixel sets from multiple cameras. The precision of location estimation by MCbSLE is enhanced through spatial intersection between polygons from different cameras. Experiments are conducted under 16 carefully designed multi-camera settings to evaluate MCbSLE w.r.t. four factors: different ports, the number of cameras, the distance between cameras, and camera headings. Results on one-day ship trajectory data show that (1) an 79.8% accuracy in the number of coordinates can be achieved by MCbSLE when there are no more than 10 ships in camera views; (2) using multiple cameras can improve the precision of location estimation by one order of magnitude compared with using one camera.",

            "title": "Routing with Massive Trajectory Data",
            "abstract": "The unprecedented availability of new types of data coupled with the invention of new technologies combine to enable entirely new or higher-resolution services that in turn enable more rational and data-driven processes. We consider the overall process of vehicular transportation and, more specifically, the process of deciding which route to follow when having to reach a destination. Early solutions modeled a road work as a graph, used sparse in-road sensor data to assign weights to graph edges, and then applied improved versions of Dijkstra's algorithm to find routes with the lowest sums of edge weights. Since then, massive vehicle trajectory data has become available. When coupled with new technologies, this data enables entirely new and higher-resolution routing services that in turn enable better routing. For more than a decade, the authors have engaged in research aimed at exploiting trajectory data to enable better routing. The resulting technologies were developed outside a DBMS. Here, we cover aspects of this research. Further, we challenge the community to develop DBMS support for these and other aspects of routing.",

            "abstract": "AIS data from ships is excellent for analyzing single-ship movements and monitoring all ships within a specific area. However, the AIS data needs to be cleaned, processed, and stored before being usable. This paper presents a system consisting of an efficient and modular ETL process for loading AIS data, as well as a distributed spatial data warehouse storing the trajectories of ships. To efficiently analyze a large set of ships, a raster approach to querying the AIS data is proposed. A spatially partitioned data warehouse with a granularized cell representation and heatmap presentation is designed, developed, and evaluated. Currently the data warehouse stores 312 million kilometers of ship trajectories and more than 8 billion rows in the largest table. It is found that searching the cell representation is faster than searching the trajectory representation. Further, we show that the spatially divided shards enable a consistently good scale-up for both cell and heatmap analytics in large areas, ranging between 354% to 1164% with a 5x increase in workers",

In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how the energy consumption of electrical vehicles behave on intersections can be paramount to save on electricity and reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. This study uses a large dataset of high-frequency trajectory data to verify the feasibility of intersection analysis and study how roundabouts fare against each other when it comes to the energy consumption of EVs. The results show that there can be a difference of 25--33% in the consumption inside roundabouts depending on their category. They also show that the speed of the vehicles as they enter the roundabouts correlates to their energy consumption in a polynomial fashion.",

            "title": "Web-Based Traffic-Sign Detection",
            "abstract": "Detecting traffic signs on images has many applications within the transportation area, e.g., speed limit detection, navigation, asset management, and autonomous vehicles. A significant challenge in detecting traffic signs is that a large set of labeled images are needed to train, test, and validate an object detector. In this paper, we demonstrate a webapp that enables traffic-sign detection of 169 common traffic signs and downloads the results. Users can contribute to improving object detection by (1) annotating user-uploaded images, (2) verifying traffic signs detected on existing imagery, or (3) donating new imagery by uploading images, e.g., taken with smartphones. The set of detected traffic signs is stepwise increased by correcting mistakes in object detection using the online verification part of the system. The user can immediately download all verified traffic-sign objects. Users can also download 43,995 traffic-sign objects from 378 different classes. This existing set of traffic-sign objects is updated nightly with objects two or more users have verified. The demonstration includes detecting traffic signs on imagery uploaded by the audience and downloading the traffic sign detected, e.g., to be used internally in an organization.",

The architecture makes use of a data lake for scalable storage of diverse mobility data sets, on top of which separate computing and storage layers are implemented to allow independent scaling with a data operations toolbox providing all data operations. Furthermore, to cater for mobility analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence support, an edge analytics suite is provided that encompasses distributed algorithms for mobility analytics and federated learning, thereby exploiting edge computing technologies. In turn, this is supported by a resource allocator that monitors the energy consumption of data-intensive operations and provides this information to the platform for intelligent task placement in edge devices, aiming at energy-efficient operations. As a result, an end-to-end platform is proposed that combines data services and infrastructure services towards supporting mobility application domains, such as urban and maritime.",

            "abstract": "While many countries are developing appropriate actions towards a greener future and moving towards adopting sustainable mobility activities, the real-time management and planning of innovative transportation facilities and services in urban environments still require the development of advanced mobile data management infrastructures. Novel green mobility solutions, such as electric, hybrid, solar and hydrogen vehicles, as well as public and gig-based transportation resources are very likely to reduce the carbon footprint. However, their successful implementation still needs efficient spatio-temporal data management resources and applications to provide a clear picture and demonstrate their effectiveness. This paper discusses the major data management challenges, open issues, and application opportunities closely related to urban green mobility. Additionally, it reports on recent successful experiences and challenging research questions. Furthermore, it highlights the global benefits one can expect when developing green mobility and emphasizes how mobile data infrastructures and services will play a crucial role in achieving these goals.",
