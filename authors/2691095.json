            "title": "All Against Some: Efficient Integration of Large Language Models for Message Passing in Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted immense attention in the past decade due to their numerous real-world applications built around graph-structured data. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) with extensive pretrained knowledge and powerful semantic comprehension abilities have recently shown a remarkable ability to benefit applications using vision and text data. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs can be leveraged in a computationally efficient fashion to benefit rich graph-structured data, a modality relatively unexplored in LLM literature. Prior works in this area exploit LLMs to augment every node features in an ad-hoc fashion (not scalable for large graphs), use natural language to describe the complex structural information of graphs, or perform computationally expensive finetuning of LLMs in conjunction with GNNs. We propose E-LLaGNN (Efficient LLMs augmented GNNs), a framework with an on-demand LLM service that enriches message passing procedure of graph learning by enhancing a limited fraction of nodes from the graph. More specifically, E-LLaGNN relies on sampling high-quality neighborhoods using LLMs, followed by on-demand neighborhood feature enhancement using diverse prompts from our prompt catalog, and finally information aggregation using message passing from conventional GNN architectures. We explore several heuristics-based active node selection strategies to limit the computational and memory footprint of LLMs when handling millions of nodes. Through extensive experiments&ablation on popular graph benchmarks of varying scales (Cora, PubMed, ArXiv,&Products), we illustrate the effectiveness of our E-LLaGNN framework and reveal many interesting capabilities such as improved gradient flow in deep GNNs, LLM-free inference ability etc.",

            "title": "An Interpretable Ensemble of Graph and Language Models for Improving Search Relevance in E-Commerce",
            "abstract": "The problem of search relevance in the E-commerce domain is a challenging one since it involves understanding the intent of a user's short nuanced query and matching it with the appropriate products in the catalog. This problem has traditionally been addressed using language models (LMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture semantic and inter-product behavior signals, respectively. However, the rapid development of new architectures has created a gap between research and the practical adoption of these techniques. Evaluating the generalizability of these models for deployment requires extensive experimentation on complex, real-world datasets, which can be non-trivial and expensive. Furthermore, such models often operate on latent space representations that are incomprehensible to humans, making it difficult to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different models. This lack of interpretability hinders the development and adoption of new techniques in the field. To bridge this gap, we propose Plug and Play Graph LAnguage Model (PP-GLAM), an explainable ensemble of plug and play models. Our approach uses a modular framework with uniform data processing pipelines. It employs additive explanation metrics to independently decide whether to include (i) language model candidates, (ii) GNN model candidates, and (iii) inter-product behavioral signals. For the task of search relevance, we show that PP-GLAM outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines as well as a proprietary model on real-world multilingual, multi-regional e-commerce datasets. To promote better model comprehensibility and adoption, we also provide an analysis of the explainability and computational complexity of our model. We also provide the public codebase and provide a deployment strategy for practical implementation.",

            "abstract": "Graphs are a fundamental data structure used to represent relationships in domains as diverse as the social sciences, bioinformatics, cybersecurity, the Internet, and more. One of the central observations in network science is that real-world graphs are globally sparse, yet contains numerous\"pockets\"of high edge density. A fundamental task in graph mining is to discover these dense subgraphs. Most common formulations of the problem involve finding a single (or a few)\"optimally\"dense subsets. But in most real applications, one does not care for the optimality. Instead, we want to find a large collection of dense subsets that covers a significant fraction of the input graph. We give a mathematical formulation of this problem, using a new definition of regularly triangle-rich (RTR) families. These families capture the notion of dense subgraphs that contain many triangles and have degrees comparable to the subgraph size. We design a provable algorithm, RTRExtractor, that can discover RTR families that approximately cover any RTR set. The algorithm is efficient and is inspired by recent results that use triangle counts for community testing and clustering. We show that RTRExtractor has excellent behavior on a large variety of real-world datasets. It is able to process graphs with hundreds of millions of edges within minutes. Across many datasets, RTRExtractor achieves high coverage using high edge density datasets. For example, the output covers a quarter of the vertices with subgraphs of edge density more than (say) $0.5$, for datasets with 10M+ edges. We show an example of how the output of RTRExtractor correlates with meaningful sets of similar vertices in a citation network, demonstrating the utility of RTRExtractor for unsupervised graph discovery tasks.",

            "abstract": "Answering real-world complex queries, such as complex product search, often requires accurate retrieval from semi-structured knowledge bases that involve blend of unstructured (e.g., textual descriptions of products) and structured (e.g., entity relations of products) information. However, previous works have mostly studied textual and relational retrieval tasks as separate topics. To address the gap, we develop STARK, a large-scale Semi-structure retrieval benchmark on Textual and Relational K nowledge Bases. Our benchmark covers three domains/datasets: product search, academic paper search, and queries in precision medicine. We design a novel pipeline to synthesize realistic user queries that integrate diverse relational information and complex textual properties, together with their ground-truth answers (items). We conduct rigorous human evaluation to validate the quality of our synthesized queries. We further enhance the benchmark with high-quality human-generated queries to provide an authentic reference. STARK serves as a comprehensive testbed for evaluating the performance of retrieval systems driven by large language models (LLMs). Our experiments suggest that STARK presents significant challenges to the current retrieval and LLM systems, indicating the demand for building more capable retrieval systems.

During optimization, we design a comparator module to iteratively provide insightful and holistic prompts to the LLM agent via reasoning between positive and negative examples sampled from training data. We demonstrate AvaTaR on four complex multimodal retrieval datasets featuring textual, visual, and relational information. We find AvaTaR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all four challenging tasks and exhibits strong generalization ability when applied to novel cases, achieving an average relative improvement of 14% on the Hit@1 metric.

            "abstract": "Link prediction is central to many real-world applications, but its performance may be hampered when the graph of interest is sparse. To alleviate issues caused by sparsity, we investigate a previously overlooked phenomenon: in many cases, a densely connected, complementary graph can be found for the original graph. The denser graph may share nodes with the original graph, which offers a natural bridge for transferring selective, meaningful knowledge. We identify this setting as Graph Intersection-induced Transfer Learning (GITL), which is motivated by practical applications in e-commerce or academic co-authorship predictions. We develop a framework to effectively leverage the structural prior in this setting. We first create an intersection subgraph using the shared nodes between the two graphs, then transfer knowledge from the source-enriched intersection subgraph to the full target graph. In the second step, we consider two approaches: a modified label propagation, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model in a teacher-student regime. Experimental results on proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source citation graphs show that the proposed workflow outperforms existing transfer learning baselines that do not explicitly utilize the intersection structure.",

            "abstract": "Developing text mining approaches to mine aspects from customer reviews has been well-studied due to its importance in understanding customer needs and product attributes. In contrast, it remains unclear how to predict the future emerging aspects of a new product that currently has little review information. This task, which we named product aspect forecasting, is critical for recommending new products, but also challenging because of the missing reviews. Here, we propose ForeSeer, a novel textual mining and product embedding approach progressively trained on temporal product graphs for this novel product aspect forecasting task. ForeSeer transfers reviews from similar products on a large product graph and exploits these reviews to predict aspects that might emerge in future reviews. A key novelty of our method is to jointly provide review, product, and aspect embeddings that are both time-sensitive and less affected by extremely imbalanced aspect frequencies. We evaluated ForeSeer on a real-world product review system containing 11,536,382 reviews and 11,000 products over 3 years. We observe that ForeSeer substantially outperformed existing approaches with at least 49.1% AUPRC improvement under the real setting where aspect associations are not given. ForeSeer further improves future link prediction on the product graph and the review aspect association prediction. Collectively, Foreseer offers a novel framework for review forecasting by effectively integrating review text, product network, and temporal information, opening up new avenues for online shopping recommendation and e-commerce applications.",

            "abstract": "Modeling customer shopping intentions is a crucial task for e-commerce, as it directly impacts user experience and engagement. Thus, accurately understanding customer preferences is essential for providing personalized recommendations. Session-based recommendation, which utilizes customer session data to predict their next interaction, has become increasingly popular. However, existing session datasets have limitations in terms of item attributes, user diversity, and dataset scale. As a result, they cannot comprehensively capture the spectrum of user behaviors and preferences. To bridge this gap, we present the Amazon Multilingual Multi-locale Shopping Session Dataset, namely Amazon-M2. It is the first multilingual dataset consisting of millions of user sessions from six different locales, where the major languages of products are English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, and Spanish. Remarkably, the dataset can help us enhance personalization and understanding of user preferences, which can benefit various existing tasks as well as enable new tasks. To test the potential of the dataset, we introduce three tasks in this work: (1) next-product recommendation, (2) next-product recommendation with domain shifts, and (3) next-product title generation. With the above tasks, we benchmark a range of algorithms on our proposed dataset, drawing new insights for further research and practice. In addition, based on the proposed dataset and tasks, we hosted a competition in the KDD CUP 2023 and have attracted thousands of users and submissions. The winning solutions and the associated workshop can be accessed at our website https://kddcup23.github.io/.",

            "title": "Simplifying Distributed Neural Network Training on Massive Graphs: Randomized Partitions Improve Model Aggregation",
            "abstract": "Distributed training of GNNs enables learning on massive graphs (e.g., social and e-commerce networks) that exceed the storage and computational capacity of a single machine. To reach performance comparable to centralized training, distributed frameworks focus on maximally recovering cross-instance node dependencies with either communication across instances or periodic fallback to centralized training, which create overhead and limit the framework scalability. In this work, we present a simplified framework for distributed GNN training that does not rely on the aforementioned costly operations, and has improved scalability, convergence speed and performance over the state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, our framework (1) assembles independent trainers, each of which asynchronously learns a local model on locally-available parts of the training graph, and (2) only conducts periodic (time-based) model aggregation to synchronize the local models. Backed by our theoretical analysis, instead of maximizing the recovery of cross-instance node dependencies -- which has been considered the key behind closing the performance gap between model aggregation and centralized training -- , our framework leverages randomized assignment of nodes or super-nodes (i.e., collections of original nodes) to partition the training graph such that it improves data uniformity and minimizes the discrepancy of gradient and loss function across instances. In our experiments on social and e-commerce networks with up to 1.3 billion edges, our proposed RandomTMA and SuperTMA approaches -- despite using less training data -- achieve state-of-the-art performance and 2.31x speedup compared to the fastest baseline, and show better robustness to trainer failures.",

            "abstract": "Training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on real-world graphs consisting of billions of nodes and edges is quite challenging, primarily due to the substantial memory needed to store the graph and its intermediate node and edge features, and there is a pressing need to speed up the training process. A common approach to achieve speed up is to divide the graph into many smaller subgraphs, which are then distributed across multiple GPUs in one or more machines and processed in parallel. However, existing distributed methods require frequent and substantial cross-GPU communication, leading to significant time overhead and progressively diminishing scalability. Here, we introduce CoFree-GNN, a novel distributed GNN training framework that significantly speeds up the training process by implementing communication-free training. The framework utilizes a Vertex Cut partitioning, i.e., rather than partitioning the graph by cutting the edges between partitions, the Vertex Cut partitions the edges and duplicates the node information to preserve the graph structure. Furthermore, the framework maintains high model accuracy by incorporating a reweighting mechanism to handle a distorted graph distribution that arises from the duplicated nodes. We also propose a modified DropEdge technique to further speed up the training process. Using an extensive set of experiments on real-world networks, we demonstrate that CoFree-GNN speeds up the GNN training process by up to 10 times over the existing state-of-the-art GNN training approaches.",
