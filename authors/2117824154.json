            "title": "Manipulating Recommender Systems: A Survey of Poisoning Attacks and Countermeasures",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems have become an integral part of online services due to their ability to help users locate specific information in a sea of data. However, existing studies show that some recommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks particularly those that involve learning schemes. A poisoning attack is where an adversary injects carefully crafted data into the process of training a model, with the goal of manipulating the system\u2019s final recommendations. Based on recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), such attacks have gained importance recently. At present, we do not have a full and clear picture of why adversaries mount such attacks, nor do we have comprehensive knowledge of the full capacity to which such attacks can undermine a model or the impacts that might have. While numerous countermeasures to poisoning attacks have been developed, they have not yet been systematically linked to the properties of the attacks. Consequently, assessing the respective risks and potential success of mitigation strategies is difficult, if not impossible. This survey aims to fill this gap by primarily focusing on poisoning attacks and their countermeasures. This is in contrast to prior surveys that mainly focus on attacks and their detection methods. Through an exhaustive literature review, we provide a novel taxonomy for poisoning attacks, formalise its dimensions, and accordingly organise 31 attacks described in the literature. Further, we review 43 countermeasures to detect and/or prevent poisoning attacks, evaluating their effectiveness against specific types of attacks. This comprehensive survey should serve as a point of reference for protecting recommender systems against poisoning attacks. The article concludes with a discussion on open issues in the field and impactful directions for future research. A rich repository of resources associated with poisoning attacks is available at https://github.com/tamlhp/awesome-recsys-poisoning.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, visual facial forgery has reached a level of sophistication that humans cannot identify fraud, which poses a significant threat to information security. A wide range of malicious applications have emerged, such as deepfake, fake news, defamation or blackmailing of celebrities, impersonation of politicians in political warfare, and the spreading of rumours to attract views. As a result, a rich body of visual forensic techniques has been proposed in an attempt to stop this dangerous trend. However, there is no comprehensive, fair, and unified performance evaluation to enlighten the community on best performing methods. The authors present a systematic benchmark beyond traditional surveys that provides in\u2010depth insights into facial forgery and facial forensics, grounding on robustness tests such as contrast, brightness, noise, resolution, missing information, and compression. The authors also provide a practical guideline of the benchmarking results, to determine the characteristics of the methods that serve as a comparative reference in this never\u2010ending war between measures and countermeasures.

            "title": "Isomorphic Graph Embedding for Progressive Maximal Frequent Subgraph Mining",
            "abstract": "Maximal frequent subgraph mining (MFSM) is the task of mining only maximal frequent subgraphs, i.e., subgraphs that are not a part of other frequent subgraphs. Although many intelligent systems require MFSM, MFSM is challenging compared to frequent subgraph mining (FSM), as maximal frequent subgraphs lie in the middle of graph lattice, and FSM algorithms must explore an exponential space and an NP-hard subroutine of frequency counting. Different from prior research, which primarily focused on optimal solutions, we introduce pmMine, a progressive graph neural framework designed for MFSM in a single large graph to attain an approximate solution. The framework combines isomorphic graph embedding, non-parametric partitioning, and an efficiently top-down pattern searching strategy. The critical insight that makes pmMine work is to define the concepts of rooted subgraph and isomorphic graph embedding, in which the costly isomorphism subroutine can be efficiently performed using similarity estimation in embedding space. In addition, pmMine returns the patterns identified during the mining process in a progressive manner. We validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our technique through extensive experiments on a variety of datasets spanning various domains.",

            "abstract": "Generating tests from question banks by using manually extracted items or involving random method consumes a great deal of time and effort. At the same time, the quality of the resulting tests is often not high. The generated tests may not entirely meet the requirements formulated in advance. Therefore, this study develops innovative ways to enhance this process by optimizing the execution time and generating results that closely meet the extraction requirements. The paper proposes the use of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to generate multiple-choice tests based on assumed objective levels of difficulty. The experimental results reveal that PSO speed-ups the extraction process, and improves the quality of tests in comparison with the results produced by previously used methods such as Random or Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimized methods. In addition, PSO shows to be more efficient than GA and random selection in most criteria, such as execution time, search space, stability, and standard deviation.",
