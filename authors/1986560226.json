            "title": "Towards Neural Scaling Laws for Foundation Models on Temporal Graphs",
            "abstract": "The field of temporal graph learning aims to learn from evolving network data to forecast future interactions. Given a collection of observed temporal graphs, is it possible to predict the evolution of an unseen network from the same domain? To answer this question, we first present the Temporal Graph Scaling (TGS) dataset, a large collection of temporal graphs consisting of eighty-four ERC20 token transaction networks collected from 2017 to 2023. Next, we evaluate the transferability of Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) for the temporal graph property prediction task by pre-training on a collection of up to sixty-four token transaction networks and then evaluating the downstream performance on twenty unseen token networks. We find that the neural scaling law observed in NLP and Computer Vision also applies in temporal graph learning, where pre-training on greater number of networks leads to improved downstream performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical demonstration of the transferability of temporal graphs learning. On downstream token networks, the largest pre-trained model outperforms single model TGNNs on thirteen unseen test networks. Therefore, we believe that this is a promising first step towards building foundation models for temporal graphs.",

In this work, we present a comparative study of deep learning (DL)-based credit score prediction models. To achieve this objective, we compare the performance of DL models against traditional methods in credit scoring. We train and test the models using a real-world dataset of credit histories, containing various features such as credit card balances, payment history, and employment status. Our experimental results show that the hybrid LSTM-GRU model outperform both the LSTM and GRU models in credit score prediction, as well as traditional methods. The hybrid LSTM-GRU model demonstrates higher accuracy and better predictive power, indicating its potential for improving credit scoring models in the financial industry.",

However, attracting customers in a highly competitive market remains a significant challenge for many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). While seeking loans for marketing operations may seem like a viable solution, there is no guarantee for success due to various challenges, such as audience reception, market competition, and shifting trends. To address these issues, we propose a groundbreaking system called \u201cCalosys,\u201d a blockchain-based P2P lending platform that employs augmented reality (AR) and smart contracts to create a token-based loan system that caters to entrepreneurs' marketing needs. Our system employs innovative lending processes, utilizing smart contracts that ensure secure transactions while allocating loan money for small business marketing activities. By utilizing augmented reality (AR), Calosys enhances customer engagement, boosting success rates and benefits for all stakeholders involved.",

            "abstract": "We propose a new ML model called Topological Forest that contains an ensemble of decision trees. Unlike a vanilla Random Forest, Topological Forest has a special training process that selects a smaller number of decision trees on a topological graph representation that TDA Mapper constructs. Compared to Vanilla Random Forest, Topological Forest significantly improves the computational efficiency of inference time due to the smaller ensemble size and selection of better decision trees while keeping the diversity of decision trees. Our experiments show that Topological Forest can speed up inference time by more than 100x on average while compromising at most 2% reduction in the AUC metric for the prediction quality.",

            "abstract": "One of the most popular platforms in token-based banking is the flexible Stellar platform. The wide range of Stellar\u2019s features allows companies to use it in modern cryptocurrency and token-based banking. This network charges a fee for each transaction. A percentage of the net amount is generated as the inflation rate of the network due to the increased number of tokens. These fees and inflationary amounts are aggregated into a general account and ultimately distributed among the network members on a collective-vote basis. In this mechanism, network users select an account as the destination to which they wish to transfer assets using their user interface, generally a wallet. This account could be the account of charities that need this help. The target distribution network is then determined based on the voting results of all members. One of the challenges in this network is the targeted and fair distribution of these funds between accounts. In this paper, the first step is a complete infrastructure of a Stellar financial network that will consist of three network-based segments of the core network, an off-chain server, and a wallet interface. In the second step, a context-aware recommendation system is implemented to solve the targeted management of payroll account selection. The results of this study concerning the importance of the targeted division of collective assets show a context-aware recommendation system as a solution to improve the process of Stellar users\u2019 participation in the voting process.",

            "abstract": "Today's world is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, as one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. During the lockdown caused by this disease, many financial losses have been inflicted on people and all industries. One of the fastest ways to save these industries from the COVID-19 or any possible pandemic in the future is to provide a reliable, fast, smart, and secure solution for people's health assessment. In this article, blockchain technology is used to propose a model which provides and validates the health certificates for people who travel or present in society.\u00a0 For this purpose, we take advantage of blockchain features such as being unchangeable, errorless, distributed, and a single point of failure nonexistence, high security, and proper use in protecting people's privacy. Since a variety of antibody and human health proving tests against the virus are developing, this study tries simultaneously to design an integrated and secure system to meet the authenticity and accuracy of different people's health certificates for the companies requiring these certifications. In this system, on the one hand, there are qualified laboratories that are responsible for performing standard testing and also providing results to the system controller. On the other hand, entities that need to receive health certificates must be members of this system. Finally, people are considered as the end-user of the system. To provide test information for the entities, the mechanism of KYC tokens will be used based on the Stellar private blockchain network. In this mechanism, the user will buy a certain amount of KYC tokens from the system controller. These tokens are charged in the user's wallet, and the user can send these tokens from his wallet to any destination company, to exchange the encrypted health certificate information. Finally, considering the appropriate platform provided by blockchain technology and the requirement of a reliable and accurate solution for issuing health certificates during the Covid-19 pandemic or any other disease, this article offers a solution to meet the requirements.",
