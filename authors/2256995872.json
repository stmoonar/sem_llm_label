            "title": "A Sampling-based Framework for Hypothesis Testing on Large Attributed Graphs",
            "abstract": "\n Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to draw conclusions about populations from sample data, typically represented in tables. With the prevalence of graph representations in real-life applications, hypothesis testing on graphs is gaining importance. In this work, we formalize node, edge, and path hypotheses on attributed graphs. We develop a sampling-based hypothesis testing framework, which can accommodate existing hypothesis-agnostic graph sampling methods. To achieve accurate and time-efficient sampling, we then propose a Path-Hypothesis-Aware SamplEr, PHASE, an\n m\n -dimensional random walk that accounts for the paths specified in the hypothesis. We further optimize its time efficiency and propose PHASE\n opt\n . Experiments on three real datasets demonstrate the ability of our framework to leverage common graph sampling methods for hypothesis testing, and the superiority of hypothesis-aware sampling methods in terms of accuracy and time efficiency.\n",

            "abstract": "In the 38th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), 2022, panel discussions were introduced after paper presentations to facilitate in-depth exploration of research topics and encourage participation. These discussions, enriched by diverse perspectives from experts and active audience involvement, provided fresh insights and a broader understanding of each topic. The introduction of panel discussions exceeded expectations, attracting a larger number of participants to the virtual sessions. This article summarizes the virtual panels held during ICDE\u201922, focusing on sessions such as Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Federated Learning, Graph Data Management, Graph Neural Networks, Spatial and Temporal Data Management, and Spatial and Temporal Data Mining. By showcasing the success of panel discussions in generating inspiring discussions and promoting participation, this article aims to bene\ufb01t the data engineering community, providing a valuable resource for researchers and suggesting a compelling format of holding research sessions for future conferences.",

            "abstract": "Transportation companies and organizations routinely collect huge volumes of passenger transportation data. By aggregating these data (e.g., counting the number of passengers going from a place to another in every 30 minute interval), it becomes possible to analyze the movement behavior of passengers in a metropolitan area. In this paper, we study the problem of finding important trends in passenger movements at varying granularities, which is useful in a wide range of applications such as target marketing, scheduling, and travel intent prediction. Specifically, we study the extraction of movement patterns between regions that have significant flow. The huge number of possible patterns render their detection computationally hard. We propose algorithms that greatly reduce the search space and the computational cost of pattern detection. We study variants of patterns that could be useful to different problem instances, such as constrained patterns and top-k ranked patterns.",
