            "title": "Instant Representation Learning for Recommendation over Large Dynamic Graphs",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems are able to learn user preferences based on user and item representations via their historical behaviors. To improve representation learning, recent recommendation models start leveraging information from various behavior types exhibited by users. In real-world scenarios, the user behavioral graph is not only multiplex but also dynamic, i.e., the graph evolves rapidly over time, with various types of nodes and edges added or deleted, which causes the Neighborhood Disturbance. Nevertheless, most existing methods neglect such streaming dynamics and thus need to be retrained once the graph has significantly evolved, making them unsuitable in the online learning environment. Furthermore, the Neighborhood Disturbance existing in dynamic graphs deteriorates the performance of neighbor-aggregation based graph models. To this end, we propose SUPA, a novel graph neural network for dynamic multiplex heterogeneous graphs. Compared to neighbor-aggregation architecture, SUPA develops a sample-update-propagate architecture to alleviate neighborhood disturbance. Specifically, for each new edge, SUPA samples an influenced subgraph, updates the representations of the two interactive nodes, and propagates the interaction information to the sampled subgraph. Furthermore, to train SUPA incrementally online, we propose InsLearn, an efficient workflow for single-pass training of large dynamic graphs. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets show that SUPA has a good generalization ability and is superior to sixteen state-of-the-art baseline methods.

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising results on exploiting node representations for many downstream tasks through supervised end-to-end training. To deal with the widespread label scarcity issue in real-world applications, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is leveraged to train GNNs with limited or even no labels by maximizing the mutual information between nodes in its augmented views generated from the original graph. However, the distribution of graphs remains unconsidered in view generation, resulting in the ignorance of unseen edges in most existing literature, which is empirically shown to be able to improve GCL's performance in our experiments. To this end, we propose to incorporate graph generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn the distribution of views for GCL, in order to i) automatically capture the characteristic of graphs for augmentations, and ii) jointly train the graph GAN model and the GCL model. Specifically, we present GACN, a novel Generative Adversarial Contrastive learning Network for graph representation learning. GACN develops a view generator and a view discriminator to generate augmented views automatically in an adversarial style. Then, GACN leverages these views to train a GNN encoder with two carefully designed self-supervised learning losses, including the graph contrastive loss and the Bayesian personalized ranking Loss. Furthermore, we design an optimization framework to train all GACN modules jointly. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets show that GACN is able to generate high-quality augmented views for GCL and is superior to twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods. Noticeably, our proposed GACN surprisingly discovers that the generated views in data augmentation finally conform to the well-known preferential attachment rule in online networks.",

            "title": "PANE-GNN: Unifying Positive and Negative Edges in Graph Neural Networks for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems play a crucial role in addressing the issue of information overload by delivering personalized recommendations to users. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) for recommender systems, capitalizing on advancements in graph representation learning. These GNN-based models primarily focus on analyzing users' positive feedback while overlooking the valuable insights provided by their negative feedback. In this paper, we propose PANE-GNN, an innovative recommendation model that unifies Positive And Negative Edges in Graph Neural Networks for recommendation. By incorporating user preferences and dispreferences, our approach enhances the capability of recommender systems to offer personalized suggestions. PANE-GNN first partitions the raw rating graph into two distinct bipartite graphs based on positive and negative feedback. Subsequently, we employ two separate embeddings, the interest embedding and the disinterest embedding, to capture users' likes and dislikes, respectively. To facilitate effective information propagation, we design distinct message-passing mechanisms for positive and negative feedback. Furthermore, we introduce a distortion to the negative graph, which exclusively consists of negative feedback edges, for contrastive training. This distortion plays a crucial role in effectively denoising the negative feedback. The experimental results provide compelling evidence that PANE-GNN surpasses the existing state-of-the-art benchmark methods across four real-world datasets. These datasets include three commonly used recommender system datasets and one open-source short video recommendation dataset.",
