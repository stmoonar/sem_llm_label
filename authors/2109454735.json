            "abstract": "The spread of fake news negatively impacts individuals and is regarded as a significant social challenge that needs to be addressed. A number of algorithmic and insightful features have been identified for detecting fake news. However, with the recent LLMs and their advanced generation capabilities, many of the detectable features (e.g., style-conversion attacks) can be altered, making it more challenging to distinguish from real news. This study proposes adversarial style augmentation, AdStyle, to train a fake news detector that remains robust against various style-conversion attacks. Our model's key mechanism is the careful use of LLMs to automatically generate a diverse yet coherent range of style-conversion attack prompts. This improves the generation of prompts that are particularly difficult for the detector to handle. Experiments show that our augmentation strategy improves robustness and detection performance when tested on fake news benchmark datasets.",

            "abstract": "The increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters demand more sophisticated approaches for rapid and precise damage assessment. To tackle this issue, researchers have developed various methods on disaster benchmark datasets from satellite imagery to aid in detecting disaster damage. However, the diverse nature of geographical landscapes and disasters makes it challenging to apply existing methods to regions unseen during training. We present DAVI (Disaster Assessment with VIsion foundation model), which overcomes domain disparities and detects structural damage (e.g., building) without requiring ground-truth labels of the target region. DAVI integrates task-specific knowledge from a model trained on source regions with an image segmentation foundation model to generate pseudo labels of possible damage in the target region. It then employs a two-stage refinement process, targeting both the pixel and overall image, to more accurately pinpoint changes in disaster-struck areas based on before-and-after images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that DAVI achieves exceptional performance across diverse terrains (e.g., USA and Mexico) and disaster types (e.g., wildfires, hurricanes, and earthquakes). This confirms its robustness in assessing disaster impact without dependence on ground-truth labels.",

Most previous defense strategies relied on vectors derived from projections of local updates on a Euclidean space; however, these methods fail to accurately represent the functionality and structure of local models, resulting in inconsistent performance. Here, we present a new paradigm to defend against poisoning attacks in federated learning using functional mappings of local models based on intermediate outputs. Experiments show that our mechanism is robust under a broad range of computing conditions and advanced attack scenarios, enabling safer collaboration among data-sensitive participants via federated learning.",

            "abstract": "Moving beyond traditional surveys, combining heterogeneous data sources with AI-driven inference models brings new opportunities to measure socio-economic conditions, such as poverty and population, over expansive geographic areas. The current research presents GeoSEE, a method that can estimate various socio-economic indicators using a unified pipeline powered by a large language model (LLM). Presented with a diverse set of information modules, including those pre-constructed from satellite imagery, GeoSEE selects which modules to use in estimation, for each indicator and country. This selection is guided by the LLM's prior socio-geographic knowledge, which functions similarly to the insights of a domain expert. The system then computes target indicators via in-context learning after aggregating results from selected modules in the format of natural language-based texts. Comprehensive evaluation across countries at various stages of development reveals that our method outperforms other predictive models in both unsupervised and low-shot contexts. This reliable performance under data-scarce setting in under-developed or developing countries, combined with its cost-effectiveness, underscores its potential to continuously support and monitor the progress of Sustainable Development Goals, such as poverty alleviation and equitable growth, on a global scale.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most critical challenges that our planet is facing today. Rising global temperatures are already affecting Earth's weather and climate patterns with an increased frequency of unpredictable and extreme events. Future projections for climate change research are based on computer models like Earth System Models (ESMs). Climate simulations typically run on a coarser grid due to the high computational resources required, and then undergo a lighter downscaling process to obtain data on a finer grid. This work presents a self-supervised deep learning model that does not require high resolution ground truth data for downscaling. This is realized by leveraging salient distribution patterns and the hidden dependencies between weather variables for an individual data point at runtime. We propose three climate-specific components that well represent the patterns of underlying weather variables and learn intricate inter-variable dependencies. Extensive evaluation with 2x, 3x, and 4x scaling factors demonstrates that our model obtains 8% to 47% performance gain over existing baselines while greatly reducing the overall runtime. The improved performance and no dependence on high resolution ground truth data make our method a valuable tool for future climate research.",

            "abstract": "Climate downscaling is a crucial technique within climate research, serving to project low-resolution (LR) climate data to higher resolutions (HR). Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning for downscaling tasks. However, most deep learning models for climate downscaling may not perform optimally for high scaling factors (i.e., 4x, 8x) due to their limited ability to capture the intricate details required for generating HR climate data. Furthermore, climate data behaves differently from image data, necessitating a nuanced approach when employing deep generative models. In response to these challenges, this paper presents a deep generative model for downscaling climate data, specifically precipitation on a regional scale. We employ a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) conditioned on multiple LR climate variables. The proposed model is evaluated using precipitation data from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) v1.2.2 simulation. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines, underscoring the effectiveness of the conditional diffusion model in downscaling climate data.",

            "title": "FedDefender: Client-Side Attack-Tolerant Federated Learning",
            "abstract": "Federated learning enables learning from decentralized data sources without compromising privacy, which makes it a crucial technique. However, it is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, where malicious clients interfere with the training process. Previous defense mechanisms have focused on the server-side by using careful model aggregation, but this may not be effective when the data is not identically distributed or when attackers can access the information of benign clients. In this paper, we propose a new defense mechanism that focuses on the client-side, called FedDefender, to help benign clients train robust local models and avoid the adverse impact of malicious model updates from attackers, even when a server-side defense cannot identify or remove adversaries. Our method consists of two main components: (1) attack-tolerant local meta update and (2) attack-tolerant global knowledge distillation. These components are used to find noise-resilient model parameters while accurately extracting knowledge from a potentially corrupted global model. Our client-side defense strategy has a flexible structure and can work in conjunction with any existing server-side strategies. Evaluations of real-world scenarios across multiple datasets show that the proposed method enhances the robustness of federated learning against model poisoning attacks.",

            "title": "Downscaling Earth System Models with Deep Learning",
            "abstract": "Modern climate models offer simulation results that provide unprecedented details at the local level. However, even with powerful supercomputing facilities, their computational complexity and associated costs pose a limit on simulation resolution that is needed for agile planning of resource allocation, parameter calibration, and model reproduction. As regional information is vital for policymakers, data from coarse-grained resolution simulations undergo the process of \"statistical downscaling\" to generate higher-resolution projection at a local level. We present a new method for downscaling climate simulations called GINE (Geospatial INformation Encoded statistical downscaling). To preserve the characteristics of climate simulation data during this process, our model applies the latest computer vision techniques over topography-driven spatial and local-level information. The comprehensive evaluations on 2x, 4x, and 8x resolution factors show that our model substantially improves performance in terms of RMSE and the visual quality of downscaled data.",
