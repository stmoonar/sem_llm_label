            "abstract": "In social sciences, simulating opinion dynamics to study the ways in which the interplay between homophily and influence leads to the formation of echo chambers is of great importance. Given the wide variety of empirical systems involving the grouping of communities based upon local attribute consensus, simulating and analyzing such dynamics is highly relevant in many other fields as well. As such, in this paper we investigate echo chambers by implementing a unique social game in which we spawn in a large number of agents, each assigned one of the two opinions on an issue and a finite amount of influence in the form of a game currency. Agents attempt to have an opinion that is a majority at the end of the game, to obtain a reward also paid in the game currency. At the beginning of each round, a randomly selected agent is selected, referred to as a speaker. The second agent is selected in the radius of speaker influence (which is a set subset of the speaker\u2019s neighbors) to interact with the speaker as a listener. In this interaction, the speaker proposes a payoff in the game currency from their personal influence budget to persuade the listener to hold the speaker\u2019s opinion in future rounds until chosen listener again. The listener can either choose to accept or reject this payoff to hold the speaker\u2019s opinion for future rounds. The listener\u2019s choice is informed only by their estimate of global majority opinion through a limited view of the opinions of their neighboring agents. We show that the influence game leads to the formation of \u201decho chambers,\u201d or homogeneous clusters of opinions. We also investigate various scenarios to disrupt the creation of such echo chambers, including the introduction of resource disparity between agents with different opinions, initially preferentially assigning opinions to agents, and the introduction of committed agents, who never change their initial opinion.",

            "title": "Simulating Online Social Response: A Stimulus/Response Perspective",
            "abstract": "The paper describes a methodology for simulating online social media activities that occur in response to external events. A large number of social media simulators model information diffusion on online social networks. However, information cascades do not originate in vacuum. Rather, they often originate as a reaction to events external to the online medium. Thus, to predict activity on the social medium, one must investigate the relation between external stimuli and online social responses. The paper presents a simulation pipeline that features stimulus/response models describing how social systems react to external events of relevance to them. Two case studies are presented to test the fidelity of different models. One investigates online responses to events in the Venezuela election crisis. The other investigates online responses to developments of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). These case studies indicate that simple macroscopic stimulus/response models can accurately predict aggregate online trends.",
