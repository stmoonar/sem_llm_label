            "abstract": "The 13th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence (EAAI-23), co-chaired by Michael Guerzhoy, Marion Neumann, and Pat Virtue, continued the tradition of the AAAI/ACM SIGAI New and Future AI Educator (NFAIED) Program to support the training of early-career university faculty, secondary school faculty, and future educators (PhD candidates or postdocs who intend a career in academia). This paper is a collection of the \"blue sky\" essays of the 2023 NFAIED awardees, intended to help motivate discussion around various current and important issues in AI education.",

As part of the program, awardees were asked to address one of the following \"blue sky\" questions: \u2022How could/should AI courses incorporate AI Ethics into the curriculum? \u2022How could we teach AI topics at an early undergraduate or a secondary school level? \u2022AI has the potential for broad impact to numerous disciplines. How could we make AI education more interdisciplinary, specifically to benefit non-engineering fields? \u2022How should standard AI courses evolve? \u2022How could we leverage AI education to promote diversity in the field? This paper is a collection of their responses, intended to help motivate discussion around these issues in AI education.",
