            "title": "Successive Clustering-Based Outlier Resistant Band Selection Method for Hyperspectral Images With Spatial Information Difference Metrics",
            "abstract": "In hyperspectral classification applications, band selection (BS) is an effective preprocessing method that reduces image redundancy without changing the original data. The property whereby different objects can be spatially separated is used for image classification, but BS methods based on quantitation of this property have not gotten enough attention. A cluster-based BS method that uses the dilation distances (DDs) with respect to the metric of spatial distances has been proposed, but the DD is strongly affected by outliers and calculating DD is time-consuming. Moreover, there is a mismatch between DD and the method of clustering and selecting representative band. In this letter, we propose a BS method based on pixel sorting-feature-based DD (SFDD) to accurately determine spatial information differences (SIDs) metric and design a method of successive clustering as well as a method of representative BS to match the features of this metric. We optimize the method to calculate the SFDD to reduce the time needed for it. In contrast to most BS methods, the bands selected by our method have a large SID among them such that objects at different positions are clearly differentiated in the spectral dimension after dimension reduction. The results of experiments showed that the proposed approach provides results that are competitive with those of several state-of-the-art methods.",

            "title": "Constrained-Target Band Selection Based on Band Combination for Hyperspectral Target Detection Using CEM",
            "abstract": "Selecting an appropriate band subset is a vital problem for hyperspectral target detection. The constrained-target band selection method, derived from constrained energy minimization (CEM), can select different band subsets according to different targets. The selected band will be used to detect the target by CEM. However, the current methods did not consider the adaptation of the selected band with CEM. We propose a constrained target band selection method based on band combination, which treats the selected band as a whole to match the input requirements of CEM to detect the specific target. Firstly, Criteria for evaluating band combination is proposed based on the constrained-target band selection method. Secondly, the features of these band combinations are proposed. Thirdly, the key band set is proposed to reduce the range of search band combinations from the whole band to a subset of the whole band, based on these features and the sparse constrained band selection (SCBS) method. Finally, the desired band combination is searched in the key band set based on these features. Experiments show that the proposed method offers promising results.",
