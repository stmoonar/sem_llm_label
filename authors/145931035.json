            "abstract": "Hate speech on social media platforms has become a severe issue in recent years. To cope with it, researchers have developed machine learning-based classification models. Due to the complexity of the problem, the models are far from perfect. A promising approach to improve them is to integrate social network data as additional features in the classification. Unfortunately, there is a lack of datasets containing text and social network data to investigate this phenomenon. Therefore, we develop an approach to identify and collect hater networks on Twitter that uses a pre-trained classification model to focus on hateful content. The contributions of this article are (1) an approach to identify hater networks and (2) an anonymized German offensive language dataset that comprises social network data. The dataset consists of 4,647,200 labeled tweets and a social graph with 49,353 users and 122,053 edges.",

            "abstract": "As emerging powers forge ahead with big data initiatives, questions arise regarding the implications of these programs for governance in the Global South more broadly. One understudied aspect deals with how actors attribute legitimacy to governments\u2019 big data activities. We explore actors\u2019 agency in one crucial case: the world\u2019s largest demographic and biometric data program, India\u2019s Aadhaar. Analyzing roughly 250,000 tweets collected in the first 10 years of Aadhaar\u2019s operation, we find that both normative acceptance and cost\u2013benefit calculations are crucial for legitimacy attribution. This finding challenges mainstream theoretical approaches, which prioritize normative factors and often fail to examine how normative and material factors interact during legitimacy attribution. In addition, our study demonstrates a new, mixed-methods approach to measuring legitimacy attribution using Twitter data, which overcomes traditional challenges. As such, we underline the viability of Twitter data as a tool for social measurement.",

            "abstract": "The Practice of Conceptual History, by Reinhart Koselleck, explores the idea that there is a direct relationship between technological advancements and an acceleration in the social construction of time. This paper will quantify this theory by measuring information density and information variety of narratives in a BOE (Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado) dataset of thirty years (1988-2018). Using Quantitative Narrative Analysis, we will define a narrative unit as a triplet of Subject, Verb, Object (SVO), and we will define information density (ID) as the ratio of narrative units per words per year. Afterwards, we will quantify the different contexts of narratives to measure information variety (IV) by constructing a network of semantic closeness from trained word embeddings. This paper will present an increased IV and ID over the observation time, indicating more and more facts being reported. The results will show evidence of an acceleration of the social construction of time.",

LOD is an invaluable resource of information due to its richness and openness, which create new opportunities for many areas of application. In this paper, we address the exploitation of LOD by utilizing SPARQL queries in order to extract social networks among entities.

Online Games are especially useful for studying social behavior patterns of collaborative teams. In our study we used longitudinal data from the Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG) Travian collected over a 12-month period that included 4,753 teams with 18,056 individuals and their communication networks. For predicting team performance, we selected 13 SNA-based attributes frequently used in team and leadership research. Using machine learning algorithms, the added explanatory power derived from the patterns of the communication networks enabled us to achieve an adjusted R2 = 0.67 in the best fitting performance prediction model and a prediction accuracy of up to 95.3% in the classification of top performing teams.",

            "abstract": "Abstract When collecting egocentric network data, visual representations of networks can function as a cognitive aid for depicting relationships, helping to maintain an overview of the relationships, and keeping the attention of the interviewees. Additionally, network maps can serve as a narration generator in qualitative and in mixed-methods studies. While varying visual instruments are used for collecting egocentric network data, little is known about differences among visual tools concerning the influence on the resulting network data, the usability for interviewees, and data validity. The article provides an overview of existing visually oriented tools that are used to collect egocentric networks and discusses their functions, advantages, and limitations. Then, we present results of an experimental study where we compare four different visual tools with regard to networks elicited, manageability, and the impact of follow-up questions. In order to assess the manageability of the four tools, we used the thinking aloud method. The results provide evidence that the decision in favor of a specific visual tool (structured vs. unstructured) can affect the size and composition of the elicited networks. Follow-up questions greatly affect the elicited networks and follow-up cues can level out differences among tools. Respondents tend to prefer the concentric circles tool, with some differences in preferences and manageability of tools between participants with low and those with high socioeconomic status. Finally, assets and drawbacks of the four instruments are discussed with regard to data quality and crucial aspects of the data collection process when using visual tools.",
