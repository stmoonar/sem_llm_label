            "abstract": "Social media plays a pivotal role in global discussions, including on climate change. The variety of opinions expressed range from supportive to oppositional, with some instances of hate speech. Recognizing the importance of understanding these varied perspectives, the 7th Workshop on Challenges and Applications of Automated Extraction of Socio-political Events from Text (CASE) at EACL 2024 hosted a shared task focused on detecting stances and hate speech in climate activism-related tweets. This task was divided into three subtasks: subtasks A and B concentrated on identifying hate speech and its targets, while subtask C focused on stance detection. Participants\u2019 performance was evaluated using the macro F1-score. With over 100 teams participating, the highest F1 scores achieved were 91.44% in subtask C, 78.58% in subtask B, and 74.83% in subtask A. This paper details the methodologies of 24 teams that submitted their results to the competition\u2019s leaderboard.",

To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive system leveraging ensemble learning techniques, capitalizing on early and late fusion approaches. Our approach employs four distinct models: mBERT, FlauBERT-base, ALBERT-base-v2, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) incorporating Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features. Through extensive experimentation, we find that our early fusion ensemble approach, featuring the integration of LSA, TF-IDF, mBERT, FlauBERT-base, and ALBERT-base-v2, delivers the best performance. Our system offers a comprehensive ESG impact type identification solution, contributing to the responsible and sustainable decision-making processes vital in today's financial and corporate governance landscape.",

            "title": "RUHate-MM: Identification of Hate Speech and Targets using Multimodal Data from Russia-Ukraine Crisis",
            "abstract": "During the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, hate speech targeted toward specific groups was widespread on different social media platforms. With most social platforms allowing multimodal content, the use of multimodal content to express hate speech is widespread on the Internet. Although there has been considerable research in detecting hate speech within unimodal content, the investigation into multimodal content remains insufficient. The limited availability of annotated multimodal datasets further restricts our ability to explore new methods to interpret and identify hate speech and its targets. The availability of annotated datasets for hate speech detection during political events, such as invasions, are even limited. To fill this gap, we introduce a comprehensive multimodal dataset consisting of 20,675 posts related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, which were manually annotated as either 'Hate Speech' or 'No Hate Speech'. Additionally, we categorize the hate speech data into three targets: 'Individual', 'Organization', and 'Community'. Our benchmarked evaluations show that there is still room for improvement in accurately identifying hate speech and its targets. We hope that the availability of this dataset and the evaluations performed on it will encourage the development of new methods for identifying hate speech and its targets during political events like invasions and wars.

            "abstract": "The discourse surrounding climate change on social media platforms has emerged as a significant avenue for understanding public sentiments, perspectives, and engagement with this critical global issue. The unavailability of publicly available datasets, coupled with ignoring the multi-aspect analysis of climate discourse on social media platforms, has underscored the necessity for further advancement in this area. To address this gap, in this paper, we present an extensive exploration of the intricate realm of climate change discourse on Twitter, leveraging a meticulously annotated ClimaConvo dataset comprising 15,309 tweets. Our annotations encompass a rich spectrum, including aspects like relevance, stance, hate speech, the direction of hate, and humor, offering a nuanced understanding of the discourse dynamics. We address the challenges inherent in dissecting online climate discussions and detail our comprehensive annotation methodology. In addition to annotations, we conduct benchmarking assessments across various algorithms for six tasks: relevance detection, stance detection, hate speech identification, direction and target, and humor analysis. This assessment enhances our grasp of sentiment fluctuations and linguistic subtleties within the discourse. Our analysis extends to exploratory data examination, unveiling tweet distribution patterns, stance prevalence, and hate speech trends. Employing sophisticated topic modeling techniques uncovers underlying thematic clusters, providing insights into the diverse narrative threads woven within the discourse. The findings present a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and communicators seeking to navigate the intricacies of climate change discussions.

            "abstract": "Addressing the need for effective hate speech moderation in contemporary digital discourse, the Multimodal Hate Speech Event Detection Shared Task made its debut at CASE 2023, co-located with RANLP 2023. Building upon its success, an extended version of the shared task was organized at the CASE workshop in EACL 2024. Similar to the earlier iteration, in this shared task, participants address hate speech detection through two subtasks. Subtask A is a binary classification problem, assessing whether text-embedded images contain hate speech. Subtask B goes further, demanding the identification of hate speech targets, such as individuals, communities, and organizations within text-embedded images. Performance is evaluated using the macro F1-score metric in both subtasks. With a total of 73 registered participants, the shared task witnessed remarkable achievements, with the best F1-scores in Subtask A and Subtask B reaching 87.27% and 80.05%, respectively, surpassing the leaderboard of the previous CASE 2023 shared task. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the performance of seven teams that submitted results for Subtask A and five teams for Subtask B.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates the integration of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) with multi-sensor information, including visual and localization data from cameras and LiDAR data to a holistic understanding of traffic videos. Traffic scene understanding is a challenging problem. With complex interaction between the road actors, infrastructure, and traffic rules, it is often difficult to answer questions related to road safety, pedestrian safety, safe maneuvering characteristics, and human factors. Typical processes use a single task-oriented neural network model and combine them through semantic and symbolic reasoning. These processes often suffer from reasoning bias and incompleteness. In recent years, LVLMs have opened new avenues to perceive spatiotemporal information. These models can leverage the large knowledge base from the world and summarize spatiotemporal information effectively. The interactive nature of most of these systems allows humans to directly interact in a visual question-answering mode.In this paper, we have extensively tested the capabilities of such LVLMs to answer key transportation research questions from videos captured through front cameras. We have curated an extensive set of multiple-choice questions to evaluate the performance of these LVLMs. Our results show that LVLMs have abilities to understand various transportation-related aspects to a great extent. Furthermore, we have shown that the addition of supplementary modalities to the VQA settings helps improve the performance of LVLMs. With the addition of 3D trajectories of surrounding objects with the 2D video frames, we observed a significant increase in MCQ performance related to vehicle-to-vehicle interaction tasks.

            "abstract": "In an era of widespread digital communication, the challenge of identifying and countering disinformation has become increasingly critical. However, compared to the solutions available in the English language, the resources and strategies for tackling this multifaceted problem in Arabic are relatively scarce. To address this issue, this paper presents our solutions to tasks in ArAIEval 2023. Task 1 focuses on detecting persuasion techniques, while Task 2 centers on disinformation detection within Arabic text. Leveraging a multi-head model architecture, fine-tuning techniques, sequential learning, and innovative activation functions, our contributions significantly enhance persuasion techniques and disinformation detection accuracy. Beyond improving performance, our work fills a critical research gap in content analysis for Arabic, empowering individuals, communities, and digital platforms to combat deceptive content effectively and preserve the credibility of information sources within the Arabic-speaking world.",
