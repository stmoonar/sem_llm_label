            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nHealthcare providers and organizations occasionally use electronic messages to provide information to patients. There is insufficient data on whether patients actually read the emails they receive. In this study, we aimed to assess the cooperation of patients in reading multiple information pages sent over 6\u00a0months from their diabetologist via email.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAdults with non-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes received via email, once every 2\u00a0weeks for 6\u00a0months, a message containing information and tips on how to improve diabetes control through lifestyle choices. The information was provided in a format that required the recipient to actively click on a \"read more\" tab in order to reveal the entire text. Each email contained a short questionnaire requesting a response. Analysis compared the effect of patient variables on co-operation with reading the emails and answering the questionnaires.\n\n\nMAIN FINDINGS\n45 patients completed the study, 53.3% of them read 66-100% of the emails, 17.8% read 34-65% of the emails and only 26.7% read less than 33% of the emails. Women answered more questionnaires than men did. Answering a questionnaire on nutrition or medications correlated with reading the following email sent.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study is the first to demonstrate that most patients do indeed read a significant portion of emails sent by their physician. Email could be an effective means of sharing information and improving patient engagement with treatment.",

            "title": "Simulation and visualization of multiple KEGG pathways using BioNSi",
            "abstract": "Motivation: Many biologists are discouraged from using network simulation tools because these require manual, often tedious network construction. This situation calls for building new tools or extending existing ones with the ability to import biological pathways previously deposited in databases and analyze them, in order to produce novel biological insights at the pathway level. Results: We have extended a network simulation tool (BioNSi), which now allows merging of multiple pathways from the KEGG pathway database into a single, coherent network, and visualizing its properties. Furthermore, the enhanced tool enables loading experimental expression data into the network and simulating its dynamics under various biological conditions or perturbations. As a proof of concept, we tested two sets of published experimental data, one related to inflammatory bowel disease condition and the other to breast cancer treatment. We predict some of the major observations obtained following these laboratory experiments, and provide new insights that may shed additional light on these results. Tool requirements: Cytoscape 3.x, JAVA 8 Availability: The tool is freely available at http://bionsi.wix.com/bionsi, where a complete user guide and a step-by-step manual can also be found.",
