            "abstract": "Pre-trained transformer language models (LMs) have in recent years become the dominant paradigm in applied NLP. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on tasks such as information extraction, question answering, sentiment analysis, document classification and many others. In the biomedical domain, significant progress has been made in adapting this paradigm to NLP tasks that require the integration of domain-specific knowledge as well as statistical modelling of language. In particular, research in this area has focused on the question of how best to construct LMs that take into account not only the patterns of token distribution in medical text, but also the wealth of structured information contained in terminology resources such as the UMLS. This work contributes a data-centric paradigm for enriching the language representations of biomedical transformer-encoder LMs by extracting text sequences from the UMLS.This allows for graph-based learning objectives to be combined with masked-language pre-training. Preliminary results from experiments in the extension of pre-trained LMs as well as training from scratch show that this framework improves downstream performance on multiple biomedical and clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. All pre-trained models, data processing pipelines and evaluation scripts will be made publicly available.",

These evaluation environments may also be evolutionary versions of some given evaluation environment. In this work, we propose a methodology to measure and understand the impact the differences between test collection representations (i.e. knowledge delta, \ud835\udca6 \u0394 ) has on system performance, and we look at the differences in their outputs (i.e. result delta, \u211b \u0394 ). We present initial experiments with various text representations on the TREC 2004 Robust Collection, and look at the relation between the \ud835\udca6 \u0394 and the \u211b \u0394 .",

            "title": "LongEval-Retrieval: French-English Dynamic Test Collection for Continuous Web Search Evaluation",
            "abstract": "LongEval-Retrieval is a Web document retrieval benchmark that focuses on continuous retrieval evaluation. This test collection is intended to be used to study the temporal persistence of Information Retrieval systems and will be used as the test collection in the Longitudinal Evaluation of Model Performance Track (LongEval) at CLEF 2023. This benchmark simulates an evolving information system environment - such as the one a Web search engine operates in - where the document collection, the query distribution, and relevance all move continuously, while following the Cranfield paradigm for offline evaluation. To do that, we introduce the concept of a dynamic test collection that is composed of successive sub-collections each representing the state of an information system at a given time step. In LongEval-Retrieval, each sub-collection contains a set of queries, documents, and soft relevance assessments built from click models. The data comes from Qwant, a privacy-preserving Web search engine that primarily focuses on the French market. LongEval-Retrieval also provides a 'mirror' collection: it is initially constructed in the French language to benefit from the majority of Qwant's traffic, before being translated to English. This paper presents the creation process of LongEval-Retrieval and provides baseline runs and analysis.",

            "abstract": "The evaluation of information retrieval systems is performed using test collections. The classical Cranfield evaluation paradigm is defined on one fixed corpus of documents and topics. Following this paradigm, several systems can only be compared over the same test collections (documents, topics, assessments). In this work, we explore in a systematic way the impact of similarity of test collections on the comparability of the experiments: characterizing the minimal changes between the collections upon which the performance of IR system evaluated can be compared. To do that, we create pair instances of sub-test collections from one reference collection with controlled overlapping elements, and we compare the Ranking of Systems (RoS) of a defined list of IR systems. We can then compute the probability that the RoS are the same across the sub-test collections. We experiment with our framework proposed on the TREC-COVID collections, and two of our findings show that: a) the ranking of systems, according to the MaP, is very stable even for overlaps smaller than 10% for documents, relevance assessments and positive relevance assessments sub-collections, and b) stability is not ensured for MaP, Rprec, Bpref and ndcg evaluation measures even when considering large overlap for the topics. \u00a9 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

This task focuses on the progression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The goal of this work is to use patient demographic data & certain medical history details along with collections of records of responses to an ALS diagnostic questionnaire to calculate risk scores corresponding to the likelihood that a patient will suffer an adverse event, and to predict the time window in which that event will occur. We present an approach based on ensemble learning, in which gradient-boosted regression trees are used to separately predict risk scores and estimate survival times. By normalising & thresholding the risk scores, we generate event predictions which are combined with the time-to-event predictions to produce time-interval predictions. While some aspects of the results seem encouraging, especially given the amount of training data available, it is clear that more sophisticated and specialised solutions are required in order for techniques like these to become a reliable part of clinical decision-making.",

            "abstract": "The explosive growth and widespread accessibility of medical information on the Internet have led to a surge of research activity in a wide range of scientific communities including health informatics and information retrieval (IR). One of the common concerns of this research, across these disciplines, is how to design either clinical decision support systems or medical search engines capable of providing adequate support for both novices (e.g., patients and their next-of-kin) and experts (e.g., physicians, clinicians) tackling complex tasks (e.g., search for diagnosis, search for a treatment). However, despite the significant multi-disciplinary research advances, current medical search systems exhibit low levels of performance. This survey provides an overview of the state of the art in the disciplines of IR and health informatics, and bridging these disciplines shows how semantic search techniques can facilitate medical IR. First,we will give a broad picture of semantic search and medical IR and then highlight the major scientific challenges. Second, focusing on the semantic gap challenge, we will discuss representative state-of-the-art work related to feature-based as well as semantic-based representation and matching models that support medical search systems. In addition to seminal works, we will present recent works that rely on research advancements in deep learning. Third, we make a thorough cross-model analysis and provide some findings and lessons learned. Finally, we discuss some open issues and possible promising directions for future research trends.",

            "abstract": ". Classical evaluations of Information Retrieval systems, under the Cran\ufb01eld Paradigm, compare several systems within one evaluation environment, de\ufb01ned by its settings (document collection, topics, assessments and evaluation measures). In this paper, we pro-pose a framework to handle the comparison of systems across several evaluation environments. To achieve this goal, we investigate the use of pivot systems, allowing an indirect comparison of systems across evaluation environments by computing Result Deltas, i.e. the differences between their evaluation measures values. We detail the proposed pivot-based methodology, de\ufb01ne a pivot characteristics and present experiments to validate our proposal (and in particular the pivot characteristics). We create altered environments that differ from their topic sets using the 2018 and 2020 CLEF eHealth evaluation campaigns (Goeuriot et al. , 2020). We explore the behaviour of the metrics and pivots measuring the correlation between the result deltas, and the ranking of systems through the pivots compared to the of\ufb01cial ranking of the systems. Our experiment show that correlations can greatly vary according to the chosen pivot and metric. We show that some pivot/metric pairs achieve high correlation values across the altered environments, with a ranking of systems similar to the of\ufb01cial ranking.",

            "abstract": "The identification of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) relies on laborious and expensive polysomnography (PSG) exams. However, it is known that other factors, easier to measure, can be good indicators of OSA and its severity. In this work, we extensively investigate the use of Machine Learning techniques in the task of determining which factors are more revealing with respect to OSA along with a discussion of the challenges to perform such a task. We ran extensive experiments over 1,042 patients from the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of the city of Grenoble, France. The data included ordinary clinical information, and PSG results as baseline. We employed data preparation techniques including cleaning of outliers, imputation of missing values, and synthetic data generation. Following, we performed an exhaustive attribute selection scheme to find the most representative features. We found that the prediction of OSA depends largely on variables related to age, body mass, and sleep habits more than the ones related to alcoholism, tabagism, and depression. Next, we tested 60 regression/classification algorithms to predict the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), and the AHI-based severity of OSA. We achieved performances significantly superior to the state of the art both for AHI regression and classification. Our results can benefit the development of tools for the automatic screening of patients who should go through polysomnography and further treatments of OSA -- currently, our work in under consideration for production by the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Grenoble. Our thorough methodology enables experimental reproducibility on similar OSA-detection problems, and more generally, on other problems with similar data models.",

The task aims to foster advances in the development of search technologies for Consumer Health Search by providing resources and evaluation methods to test and validate search systems. Built upon the the 2013-17 series of CLEF eHealth Information Retrieval tasks, the 2018 task considers both mono- and multilingual retrieval, embracing the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) -style evaluation process with a shared collection of documents and queries, the contribution of runs from participants and the subsequent formation of relevance assessments and evaluation of the participants submissions. For this year, the CHS task uses a new Web corpus and a new set of queries compared to the previous years. The new corpus consists of Web pages acquired from the CommonCrawl and the new set of queries consists of 50 queries issued by the general public to the Health on the Net (HON) search services. We then manually translated the 50 queries to French, German, and Czech; and obtained English query variations of the 50 original queries. A total of 7 teams from 7 di\ufb00erent countries participated in the 2018 CHS CUNI (Czech Republic), IMS (Italy), MIRACL (Tunisia), QUT (Australia), SINAI (Spain), UB-Botswana (Botswana), and UEvora (Portugal).",

            "abstract": "Cascaded speech recognition (SR) and information extraction (IE) could support the best practice for clinical handover and release clinicians\u2019 time from writing documents to patient interaction and education. However, high requirements for processing correctness evoke methodological challenges and hence, processing correctness needs to be carefully evaluated as meeting the requirements. This overview paper reports on how these issues were addressed in a shared task of the eHealth evaluation lab of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) in 2016. This IE task built on the 2015 CLEF eHealth Task on SR by using its 201 synthetic handover documents for training and validation (appr. 8, 500 + 7, 700 words) and releasing another 100 documents with over 6, 500 expert-annotated words for testing. It attracted 25 team registrations and 3 team submissions with 2 methods each. When using the macro-averaged F1 over the 35 form headings present in the training documents for evaluation on the test documents, all participant methods outperformed all 4 baselines, including the organizers\u2019 method (F1 = 0.25), published in 2015 in a top-tier medical informatics journal and provided to the participants as an option to build on, a random classifier (F1 = 0.02), and majority classifiers for the two most common classes (i.e., NA to filter out text irrelevant to the form and the most common form heading, both with F1 < 0.00). The top-2 methods (F1 = 0.38 and 0.37) had statistically significantly (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) better performance than the third-best method (F1 = 0.35). In comparison, the top-3 methods and the organizers\u2019 method (7th) had F1 of 0.81, 0.80, 0.81, and 0.75 in the NA class, respectively.",

The task continued with named entity recognition and normalization in French narratives, as offered in CLEF eHealth 2015. Named entity recognition involved ten types of entities including disorders that were defined according to Semantic Groups in the Unified Medical Language System\u00ae (UMLS\u00ae), which was also used for normalizing the entities. In addition, we introduced a large-scale classification task in French death certificates, which consisted of extracting causes of death as coded in the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD10). Participant systems were evaluated against a blind reference standard of 832 titles of scientific articles indexed in MEDLINE, 4 drug monographs published by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and 27,850 death certificates using Precision, Recall and F-measure. In total, seven teams participated, including five in the entity recognition and normalization task, and five in the death certificate coding task. Three teams submitted their systems to our newly offered reproducibility track. For entity recognition, the highest performance was achieved on the EMEA corpus, with an overall F-measure of 0.702 for plain entities recognition and 0.529 for normalized entity recognition. For entity normalization, the highest performance was achieved on the MEDLINE corpus, with an overall F-measure of 0.552. For death certificate coding, the highest performance was 0.848 F-measure.",

The task aims to foster advances in the development of search technologies for consumer health search by providing resources and evaluation methods to test and validate search systems. The problem considered in this year\u2019s task was to retrieve web pages to support the information needs of health consumers that are faced by a medical condition and that want to seek relevant health information online through a search engine. As part of the evaluation exercise, we gathered 300 queries users posed with respect to 50 search task scenarios. The scenarios were developed from real cases of people seeking health information through posting requests of help on a web forum. The presence of query variations for a single scenario helped us capturing the variable quality at which queries are posed. Queries were created in English and then translated into other languages. A total of 49 runs by 10 different teams were submitted for the English query topics; 2 teams submitted 29 runs for the multilingual topics.",

We use a learning to rank approach with standard retrieval features to determine topical relevance and additional features based on readability measures and medical lexical aspects to determine understandability. Our experiments measured the effectiveness of the learning to rank approach integrating understandability on a consumer health benchmark. The findings suggest that this approach promotes documents that are at the same time topically relevant and understandable.",

This task investigates the effectiveness of web search engines in providing access to medical information with the aim of fostering advances in the development of these technologies. The problem considered in this year\u2019s task was to retrieve web pages to support information needs of health consumers that are confronted with a sign, symptom or condition and that seek information through a search engine, with the aim to understand which condition they may have. As part of this evaluation exercise, 66 query topics were created by potential users based on images and videos of conditions. Topics were first created in English and then translated into a number of other languages. A total of 97 runs by 12 different teams were submitted for the English query topics; one team submitted 70 runs for the multilingual topics.",

Cascaded speech recognition (SR) and information extraction could support their compliance and release clinicians' time from writing documents to patient interaction and education. However, high requirements for processing correctness evoke methodological challenges. First, multiple people speak clin- ical jargon in the presence of background noise with limited possibilities for SR personalization. Second, errors multiply in cascading and hence, SR correctness needs to be carefully evaluated as meeting the requirements. This overview pa- per reports on how these issues were addressed in a shared task of the eHealth evaluation lab of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum in 2015. The task released 100 synthetic handover documents for training and another 100 documents for testing in both verbal and written formats. It attracted 48 team registrations, 21 email confirmations, and four method submissions by two teams. The submissions were compared against a leading commercial SR engine and simple majority baseline. Although this engine performed signifi- cantly better than any submission (i.e., 38.5 vs. 52.8 test error percentage of the best submission with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test value of 302.5 (p < 10 -12 )), the releases of data, tools, and evaluations contribute to the body of knowledge on the task difficulty and method suitability.",

This work is conducted in the framework of a medical evaluation campaign, which aims to evaluate and improve technologies to help patients and laypeople access eHealth data. To this end, the campaign is composed of different tasks, including a medical information retrieval (IR) task. Within this IR task, a web crawl of medically related documents, as well as patient queries are provided to participants. The queries are built to represent the potential information needs patients may have while reading their medical report. We start by describing typical types of patients\u2019 information needs. We then describe how these queries have been manually generated from medical reports for the first two years of the eHealth campaign. We then explore techniques that would enable us to automate the query generation process. This \nprocess is particularly challenging, as it requires an understanding of the patients\u2019 information needs, and of the electronic health records. We describe various approaches to automatically generate potential patient queries from medical reports and describe our future \ndevelopment and evaluation phase.",

Of fifty registra- tions, only the FLPolytech team completed all requirements related to the task. They augmented the discharge summary by linking to external resources, insert- ing structure related to timing of the information need (past, present future), en- riching the content, i.e., with definitions, and providing meta-information, e.g., how to make future appointments. Four panellists evaluated the submission. Overall, they were positive about the enhancements, but all agreed that addi- tional visualization could further improve the provided solution.",

The task objective was to investigate the eect of using additional information such as a related discharge summary and external resources such as medical ontologies on the eectiveness of information retrieval systems, in a monolingual (Task 3a) and in a multilingual (Task 3b) context. The participants were al- lowed to submit up to seven runs for each language (English, Czech, French, German), one mandatory run using no additional information or external resources, and three each using or not using discharge sum- maries.",

Our analysis is based on data and runs for Task 3 of the CLEF 2013 eHealth lab, which provided patient queries and a large medical document collection for patient centred medical information retrieval technique development. We categorise the queries based on their complexity, which is defined as the number of medical concepts they contain. We then show how query complexity affects performance of runs submitted to the lab, and provide suggestions for improving retrieval quality for this complex retrieval task and similar IR evaluation tasks.",

The Khresmoi system uses a component based architecture housed in the cloud to allow for the development of several innovative applications to support target users medical information needs. The Khresmoi search systems based on this architecture have been designed to support the multilingual and multimod al information needs of three target groups the general public, general practitioners and consultant radiologists. In this paper we focus on the presentation of the systems to support the latter two groups using semantic, multilingual text and image based (including 2D and 3D radiology images) search.",

The task was comprised of two subtasks: attribute normalization (task 2a) and cue identification (task 2b). We instructed participants to develop a system which either kept or updated a default attribute value for each task. Participant systems were evaluated against a blind reference standard of 133 discharge summaries using Accuracy (task 2a) and F-score (task 2b). In total, ten teams participated in task 2a, and three teams in task 2b. For task 2a and 2b, the HITACHI team systems (run 2) had the highest performances, with an overall average average accuracy of 0.868 and F1-score (strict) of 0.676, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Searching for health advice on the web is becoming increasingly common. Because of the great importance of this activity for patients and clinicians and the effect that incorrect information may have on health outcomes, it is critical to present relevant and valuable information to a searcher. Previous evaluation campaigns on health information retrieval (IR) have provided benchmarks that have been widely used to improve health IR and record these improvements. However, in general these benchmarks have targeted the specialised information needs of physicians and other healthcare workers. In this paper, we describe the development of a new collection for evaluation of effectiveness in IR seeking to satisfy the health information needs of patients. Our methodology features a novel way to create statements of patients\u2019 information needs using realistic short queries associated with patient discharge summaries, which provide details of patient disorders. We adopt a scenario where the patient then creates a query to seek information relating to these disorders. Thus, discharge summaries provide us with a means to create contextually driven search statements, since they may include details on the stage of the disease, family history etc. The collection will be used for the first time as part of the ShARe/-CLEF 2013 eHealth Evaluation Lab, which focuses on natural language processing and IR for clinical care.",

Several existing information retrieval (IR) evaluation campaigns have been developed to assess and improve medical IR methods, for example the TREC Medical Record Track [11] and TREC Genomics Track [10]. These campaigns only target certain \ntype of users, mainly clinicians and some medical professionals: queries are mainly centered on cohorts of records describing a specific patient cases or on biomedical reports. Evaluating search effectiveness \nover the many heterogeneous online medical information \nsources now available, which are increasingly used by a diverse range of medical professionals and, very importantly, the general public, is vital to the understanding and development of medical IR. We describe the development of two benchmarks for medical IR evaluation from the Khresmoi project. The first of these has been developed using existing medical query logs for internal research within the Khresmoi project and targets both medical professionals and general public; the second has been created in the framework of a new CLEFeHealth evaluation campaign and is designed to evaluate patient search in context.",

We performed initial experiments on the 2011 TRECMed data based on the BM25 retrieval model. Surprisingly, we found that the standard BM25 model with default parameters performs comparable to the best automatic runs submitted to TRECMed 2011 and our experiments would have ranked among the top four out of 29 participating groups. We expected that some form of domain adaptation would increase performance. However results on the 2011 data proved otherwise: query expansion decreased performance, and filtering and reranking by term proximity also decreased performance slightly. We submitted four runs based on the BM25 retrieval model to TRECMed 2012 using standard BM25, standard query expansion, result filtering, and concept-based query expansion. Official results for 2012 confirm that domain-specific knowledge, as applied by us, does not increase performance compared to the BM25 baseline.",

Lexical resources, such as polarized lexicons, are needed for this task. Opinion mining in the medical domain has not been well explored, partly because little credence is given to patients and their opinions (although more and more of them are using social media). We are interested in opinion mining of user-generated content on drugs/medication. We present in this paper the creation of our lexical resources and their adaptation to the medical domain. We first describe the creation of a general lexicon, containing opinion words from the general domain and their polarity. Then we present the creation of a medical opinion lexicon, based on a corpus of drug reviews. We show that some words have a different polarity in the general domain and in the medical one. Some words considered generally as neutral are opinionated in medical texts. We finally evaluate the lexicons and show with a simple algorithm that using our general lexicon gives better results than other well-known ones on our corpus and that adding the domain lexicon improves them as well.",

            "abstract": "Khresmoi aims to provide a multilingual and multimodal search and access system for biomedical information and documents, which targets three classes of user. Two of these are groups with general medical interests: the gen- eral public and general medical practitioners. The other is an example clinician group with a specific expertise: radiologists. Khresmoi targets diverse users, with: varying native language, language skills, medical knowledge, information needs or querying behaviour. The system seeks to provide these groups with in- novative and effective services for searching through the large amount of avail- able medical information. It gathers several innovative technologies linked to medical information (e.g. information extraction and retrieval, machine transla- tion) to provide a comprehensive tool adapted to all users. In parallel to the de- velopment of the search system, a global evaluation strategy is being designed to enable an assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of the developed technologies and of the quality of the support provided to the target users. The- se evaluation plans consist of both empirical and user-centred evaluations. We focus here on user-centred evaluations. Creation of holistic user-centred evalua- tion approaches allows to evaluate the search application in a comprehensive way while being mindful of the diversity of users. First steps in this strategy re- late to the experimental subjects and evaluation scenarios. Firstly, demographic features of each class of user have to be defined in order to get representative groups. Gaining subjects of this nature can be problematic, especially when medical professionals are required, and it raises issues such as the payment of subjects, or the geographic distance between subjects and investigators. Moreo- ver, the Khresmoi system is intended for use by individuals with different na- tive languages and different skills in the English language. Again, this raises is- sues such as gaining a good spread of subjects with different language skills, as well as the assessment of subjects' language skills. To determine the demo- graphic spread of subjects, standard questionnaires should be completed by sub- jects to determine their age, gender, medical condition, prior use of medical search engines, computer skill, etc. Secondly, a robust methodology for scenar- io creation has to be developed.

We present work from the Khresmoi project which aims to develop a multilingual multimodal search and access system for biomedical information and documents. Khresmoi targets three distinct user classes with differing levels of medical knowledge and information requirements, namely: general public, general practitioners, and, as an example of an area of clinical expertise, radiologists. The Khresmoi system will provide these users with valuable (whose quality has been evaluated and approved) and enriched (meta information from biomedical knowledge bases is added) medical information, selected to fit their medical knowledge and their preferred language. The system will include novel collaborative components of the system are designed to provide means for users to contribute to the system\u2019s knowledge by adding or correcting annotations to the documents, as well as a collaborative platform where they will be able to share their own files and both annotate and discuss them.",

            "abstract": "This paper develops techniques to mine medical and health-related social media content for information and opinions about diseases and treatments. This would allow users to benefit from the numerous postings of people's experiences scattered all over the Web. This paper reports the results of a textual analysis of user-generated content on drug-related online sites. The aim is to determine what kinds of content can be expected on these sites, from linguistic and information points-of-view. User postings were harvested from two websites carrying different kinds of user-generated content and compared to information on the same drugs from a hospital information portal. The corpus was analyzed to identify what kinds of drugs were often reviewed, the vocabulary and medical concepts used, and the textual characteristics such as length of postings, sentence length, and part-of-speech distribution. Although drug-related user-generated content is very different from editorial content, the results of this project show that it provides useful information on many drugs. From a linguistic point-of-view, user-generated content is simpler in language and more informal in style than editorial content, but still contains useful health information that tends to be patient-oriented.",

            "abstract": "With the growth of textual data, techniques are necessary for their selection and organization. The organization of textual documents belonging to specialized languages relies mainly on information reflecting the subject domain, the genre of the document and its communication level. This paper aims to distinguish different levels of specialized documents: scientific documents and popular science documents. Identifying the communication level of a document requires a modality analysis that characterizes the relationship between the author and the content. In this paper, we investigate the relevancy of two modality theories defined for general language in order to characterize texts in the medical field. Furthermore, we compare these theories with respect to their multilingual adaptation working on French and Japanese. We show that the automation of both theories using specific features is possible, but because of paucity and ambiguity problems, only one is fully operational and scales efficiently.",

            "abstract": "We present in this paper the development of a specialized comparable corpora compilation tool, for which quality would be close to a manually compiled corpus. The comparability is based on three levels: domain, topic and type of discourse. Domain and topic can be filtered with the keywords used through web search. But the detection of the type of discourse needs a wide linguistic analysis. The first step of our work is to automate the detection of the type of discourse that can be found in a scientific domain (science and popular science) in French and Japanese languages. First, a contrastive stylistic analysis of the two types of discourse is done on both languages. This analysis leads to the creation of a reusable, generic and robust typology. Machine learning algorithms are then applied to the typology, using shallow parsing. We obtain good results, with an average precision of 80% and an average recall of 70% that demonstrate the efficiency of this typology. This classification tool is then inserted in a corpus compilation tool which is a text collection treatment chain realized through IBM UIMA system. Starting from two specialized web documents collection in French and Japanese, this tool creates the corresponding corpus.",

We work separately with corpora composed of documents from the medical domain in three languages (French, Japanese and Russian) which present an important linguistic distance between them. In our approach, documents are characterized in each language by their topic and by a discursive typology positioned at three levels of document analysis: structural, modal and lexical. The document typology is implemented with two learning algorithms (SVMlight and C4.5). Evaluation of results shows that the proposed discursive typology can be transposed from one language to another, as it indeed allows to distinguish the two aimed discourses (science and popular science). However, we observe that performances vary a lot according to languages, algorithms and types of discursive characteristics.",

In this paper we propose a typology of criteria to distinguish between science and popular science, based on observations of Web documents, forming a part of a comparable corpus. This typology holds two dimensions: the external dimension, characterizing the web site creation context, and the internal one, characterizing the communicative tasks of the website and its documents (graphical and textual characteristics). Then the criteria of the typology will be implemented to automatically classify Web documents between scientific and popular-science register. That is a first step to the automate of a comparable corpus of Web documents.",
