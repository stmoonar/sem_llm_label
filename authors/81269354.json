            "title": "Rethinking Knowledge Transfer in Learning Using Privileged Information",
            "abstract": "In supervised machine learning, privileged information (PI) is information that is unavailable at inference, but is accessible during training time. Research on learning using privileged information (LUPI) aims to transfer the knowledge captured in PI onto a model that can perform inference without PI. It seems that this extra bit of information ought to make the resulting model better. However, finding conclusive theoretical or empirical evidence that supports the ability to transfer knowledge using PI has been challenging. In this paper, we critically examine the assumptions underlying existing theoretical analyses and argue that there is little theoretical justification for when LUPI should work. We analyze LUPI methods and reveal that apparent improvements in empirical risk of existing research may not directly result from PI. Instead, these improvements often stem from dataset anomalies or modifications in model design misguidedly attributed to PI. Our experiments for a wide variety of application domains further demonstrate that state-of-the-art LUPI approaches fail to effectively transfer knowledge from PI. Thus, we advocate for practitioners to exercise caution when working with PI to avoid unintended inductive biases.",

            "title": "Practical Bandits: An Industry Perspective",
            "abstract": "The bandit paradigm provides a unified modeling framework for problems that require decision-making under uncertainty. Because many business metrics can be viewed as rewards (a.k.a. utilities) that result from actions, bandit algorithms have seen a large and growing interest from industrial applications, such as search, recommendation and advertising. Indeed, with the bandit lens comes the promise of direct optimisation for the metrics we care about. Nevertheless, the road to successfully applying bandits in production is not an easy one. Even when the action space and rewards are well-defined, practitioners still need to make decisions regarding multi-arm or contextual approaches, on- or off-policy setups, delayed or immediate feedback, myopic or long-term optimisation, etc. To make matters worse, industrial platforms typically give rise to large action spaces in which existing approaches tend to break down. The research literature on these topics is broad and vast, but this can overwhelm practitioners, whose primary aim is to solve practical problems, and therefore need to decide on a specific instantiation or approach for each project. This tutorial will take a step towards filling that gap between the theory and practice of bandits. Our goal is to present a unified overview of the field and its existing terminology, concepts and algorithms---with a focus on problems relevant to industry. We hope our industrial perspective will help future practitioners who wish to leverage the bandit paradigm for their application.",

            "abstract": "Bandit algorithms are often used in the e-commerce industry to train Machine Learning (ML) systems when pre-labeled data is unavailable. However, the industry setting poses various challenges that make implementing bandit algorithms in practice non-trivial. In this paper, we elaborate on the challenges of off-policy optimisation, delayed reward, concept drift, reward design, and business rules constraints that practitioners at Booking.com encounter when applying bandit algorithms. Our main contributions is an extension to the Open Bandit Pipeline (OBP) framework. We provide simulation components for some of the above-mentioned challenges to provide future practitioners, researchers, and educators with a resource to address challenges encountered in the e-commerce industry.",

            "abstract": "The visual appearance of a webpage carries valuable information about the page's quality and can be used to improve the performance of learning to rank (LTR). We introduce the Visual learning TO Rank (ViTOR) model that integrates state-of-the-art visual features extraction methods: (i) transfer learning from a pre-trained image classification model, and (ii) synthetic saliency heat maps generated from webpage snapshots. Since there is currently no public dataset for the task of LTR with visual features, we also introduce and release the ViTOR dataset, containing visually rich and diverse webpages. The ViTOR dataset consists of visual snapshots, non-visual features and relevance judgments for ClueWeb12 webpages and TREC Web Track queries. We experiment with the proposed ViTOR model on the ViTOR dataset and show that it significantly improves the performance of LTR with visual features.",
