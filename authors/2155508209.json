            "title": "Practical Bandits: An Industry Perspective",
            "abstract": "The bandit paradigm provides a unified modeling framework for problems that require decision-making under uncertainty. Because many business metrics can be viewed as rewards (a.k.a. utilities) that result from actions, bandit algorithms have seen a large and growing interest from industrial applications, such as search, recommendation and advertising. Indeed, with the bandit lens comes the promise of direct optimisation for the metrics we care about. Nevertheless, the road to successfully applying bandits in production is not an easy one. Even when the action space and rewards are well-defined, practitioners still need to make decisions regarding multi-arm or contextual approaches, on- or off-policy setups, delayed or immediate feedback, myopic or long-term optimisation, etc. To make matters worse, industrial platforms typically give rise to large action spaces in which existing approaches tend to break down. The research literature on these topics is broad and vast, but this can overwhelm practitioners, whose primary aim is to solve practical problems, and therefore need to decide on a specific instantiation or approach for each project. This tutorial will take a step towards filling that gap between the theory and practice of bandits. Our goal is to present a unified overview of the field and its existing terminology, concepts and algorithms---with a focus on problems relevant to industry. We hope our industrial perspective will help future practitioners who wish to leverage the bandit paradigm for their application.",

            "title": "Investment Selection Based on Bonferroni Mean under Generalized Probabilistic Hesitant Fuzzy Environments",
            "abstract": "In investment selection problems, the existence of contingency and uncertainty may result in the loss of attribute information. Then, how to make proper investment decision-making will be a tricky proposition. In this work, a multiattribute group decision making (MAGDM) method based on the generalized probabilistic hesitant fuzzy Bonferroni mean (GPHFBM) operator is constructed, which enables decision-makers to select the proper parameters in decision-making process. Firstly, the GPHFBM operator is proposed by combining the Bonferroni mean operator and Archimedean norm. Secondly, five excellent properties of the GPHFBM operator are discussed in detail. In view of applications, we further develop some special aggregation operators for GPHFBM with the various values of parameters b, d and additive operators g(t). Finally, we propose a probabilistic hesitant fuzzy MAGDM method based on the GPHFBM operator to analyze the aggregated information. A case study of the investment of social insurance funds is given to depict the validity and reasonability of the proposed method. Ultimately, the company X4 is selected as the investment company with the best comprehensive indicator.",
