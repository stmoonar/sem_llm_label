            "abstract": "\n The recommender system (RS) has been an integral toolkit of online services. They are equipped with various deep learning techniques to model user preference based on identifier and attribute information. With the emergence of multimedia services, such as short videos, news and\n etc.\n , understanding these contents while recommending becomes critical. Besides, multimodal features are also helpful in alleviating the problem of data sparsity in RS. Thus,\n M\n ultimodal\n R\n ecommender\n S\n ystem (MRS) has attracted much attention from both academia and industry recently. In this paper, we will give a comprehensive survey of the MRS models, mainly from technical views. First, we conclude the general procedures and major challenges for MRS. Then, we introduce the existing MRS models according to four categories,\n i.e.,\n Modality Encoder\n ,\n Feature Interaction\n ,\n Feature Enhancement\n and\n Model Optimization\n . Besides, to make it convenient for those who want to research this field, we also summarize the dataset and code resources. Finally, we discuss some promising future directions of MRS and conclude this paper. To access more details of the surveyed papers, such as implementation code, we open source a repository.\n",

            "abstract": "With the explosive growth of commercial applications of recommender systems, multi-scenario recommendation (MSR) has attracted considerable attention, which utilizes data from multiple domains to improve their recommendation performance simultaneously. However, training a unified deep recommender system (DRS) may not explicitly comprehend the commonality and difference among domains, whereas training an individual model for each domain neglects the global information and incurs high computation costs. Likewise, fine-tuning on each domain is inefficient, and recent advances that apply the prompt tuning technique to improve fine-tuning efficiency rely solely on large-sized transformers. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-enhanced paradigm for multi-scenario recommendation. Specifically, a unified DRS backbone model is first pre-trained using data from all the domains in order to capture the commonality across domains. Then, we conduct prompt tuning with two novel prompt modules, capturing the distinctions among various domains and users. Our experiments on Douban, Amazon, and Ali-CCP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm with two noticeable strengths: (i) its great compatibility with various DRS backbone models, and (ii) its high computation and storage efficiency with only 6% trainable parameters in prompt tuning phase. The implementation code is available for easy reproduction.",

In the past few decades, the rapid developments of recommender systems have significantly benefited human by creating economic value, saving time and effort, and promoting social good. However, recent studies have found that data-driven recommender systems can pose serious threats to users and society, such as spreading fake news to manipulate public opinion in social media sites, amplifying unfairness toward under-represented groups or individuals in job matching services, or inferring privacy information from recommendation results. Therefore, systems' trustworthiness has been attracting increasing attention from various aspects for mitigating negative impacts caused by recommender systems, so as to enhance the public's trust towards recommender systems techniques. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of Trustworthy Recommender systems (TRec) with a specific focus on six of the most important aspects; namely, Safety&Robustness, Nondiscrimination&Fairness, Explainability, Privacy, Environmental Well-being, and Accountability&Auditability.

It is noted that KGCN is mainly used to capture the correlations between items; they generally ignore the correlations between users, thus resulting in insufficient accuracy of recommendation outcomes. In this study, we developed a model hybrid recommendation approach based on knowledge graph convolution network collaborative filtering (KGCN-CF). This approach adds user-based collaborative filtering based on KGCN to capture the correlations between users, which counterbalances the defects of KGCN, while addressing the sparsity and cold start complications of collaborative filtering to a certain extent. The proposed approach was applied to three datasets provided by Dianping-Food, Book-Crossing, and Last.FM. The experimental results demonstrated that this approach can effectively improve the area under the curve (AUC) and F1-measure of the recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Effective traffic forecasting contributes to the public safety and urban management, and the complexity and variability of the traffic system make it difficult to predict traffic over a long-term horizon. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the spatio-temporal features of traffic, and propose a spatio-temporal multi-scale convolutional net-work (ST-MSCN) to solve the problem of traffic flow prediction. First, in order to directly capture the spatial dependence and multi-scale features of urban traffic flow, we propose an MSC unit. In addition, this paper also proposes a multi-level feature fusion strategy to combine low-level surface features and high-level abstract features to effectively avoid feature loss. Finally, we propose an early fusion mechanism and combine it with the MSC unit to ensure the improved prediction results while greatly reducing the complexity of the model. As for the simulation, Beijing taxi trajectory data and New York City bicycle trajectory data are used to carry out the simulation experiments. The experimental results show the advanced nature of our model, and prediction accuracy are 7.58% \u223c 9.23% higher than state-of-the-art.",

But two problems, unknown counterfactual outcome and confounder, are the barriers for making a good ITE estimation. Although some representation learning methods based on potential outcome framework have been proposed to solve the problems, we \ufb01nd that most of previous works assume all features (also named covariate) of a unit are confounders. However, this assumption is not easy to become true, because instrument variables, adjustment variables and irrelevant variables can also be included in features. Therefore, this paper proposes a simple method to split covariates, and then a network, Split Covariate Representation Network (SCRNet), is mentioned, which is used to estimate ITE by di\ufb00erent kinds of variables. Experiment results show that our method outperforms other state-of-arts methods on IHDP, a semi-synthetic dataset, and Jobs, a real-world dataset.",

            "title": "Bribery in Rating System: A Game-Theoretic Perspective",
            "abstract": "The rich revenue gained from a mobile application ($a.k.a.$ app) boost app owners (sellers) to manipulate the app store with fake ratings. One effective way to hire fake rating providers is bribery. The fake ratings given by the bribed buyers influence the evaluation of the app, which further have an impact on the decision-making of potential buyers. In this paper, we study bribery in a rating system with multiple sellers and buyers, which extends the single seller situation discussed in \\cite{Grandi2016}. We analyze the effect of bribing strategy using game theory methodology and examine the existence of its an equilibrium state, in which the rating system is expected to be bribery-proof: no bribery strategy yields a strictly positive expected gain to the seller. Our study first concentrate on the analysis of static game with a fixed number of sellers and buyers, then we model real-world setting towards a dynamic game. On top of our analysis, we conclude at least one Nash equilibrium can be reached in the bribery game of rating system.",
