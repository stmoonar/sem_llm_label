            "title": "Pretrained Embeddings for E-commerce Machine Learning: When it Fails and Why?",
            "abstract": "The use of pretrained embeddings has become widespread in modern e-commerce machine learning (ML) systems. In practice, however, we have encountered several key issues when using pretrained embedding in a real-world production system, many of which cannot be fully explained by current knowledge. Unfortunately, we find that there is a lack of a thorough understanding of how pre-trained embeddings work, especially their intrinsic properties and interactions with downstream tasks. Consequently, it becomes challenging to make interactive and scalable decisions regarding the use of pre-trained embeddings in practice. Our investigation leads to two significant discoveries about using pretrained embeddings in e-commerce applications. Firstly, we find that the design of the pretraining and downstream models, particularly how they encode and decode information via embedding vectors, can have a profound impact. Secondly, we establish a principled perspective of pre-trained embeddings via the lens of kernel analysis, which can be used to evaluate their predictability, interactively and scalably. These findings help to address the practical challenges we faced and offer valuable guidance for successful adoption of pretrained embeddings in real-world production. Our conclusions are backed by solid theoretical reasoning, benchmark experiments, as well as online testings.",

            "abstract": "1 FOREWORD Most of the recent progress in information retrieval (IR) and recommender systems has been fueled by deep learning: the success of neural networks has brought tremendous opportunities to model highly complex patterns for prediction. However, algorithmic advances on accurate predictions and improved user modeling are just a small part of designing considerations of a much larger system. IR and recommender systems difer from other machine learning domains because they are inherently part of an ecosystem \u2013 in the simplest case, a world of items and users. In these ecosystems, system designers face a broad range of decisions \u2013 e.g., how to balance popularity, which incentives should be given to which users, or what safeguards to put in place to ensure the platform thrives in the long-run. Some of the decision making problems are statistical and algorithmic in nature, such as coping with the uncertainty of data and models, while others can involve building systems for the satisfactory of multiple parties. In general, there are many complex decision-making challenges faced by real-world IR and recommender systems, but existing approaches often make oversimplifed assumptions about the environment, data, and human behavior. Ignoring those challenges or treating them simply as pattern recognition problems can cost the engagement, accessibility, fairness, inclusiveness, and ultimately the vitality of IR and recommendation systems.",

While the advances related to this relative new technology have been developed in multiple domains, it lacks in the literature a systematic and complete treatment of the procedure that involves exploration, inference, and analysis. This short paper aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of adaptive online testing, including various building blocks and analytical results. We also address the latest developments, research directions, and challenges that have been less mentioned in the literature.",

            "abstract": "Off-policy learning plays a pivotal role in optimizing and evaluating policies prior to the online deployment. However, during the real-time serving, we observe varieties of interventions and constraints that cause inconsistency between the online and offline setting, which we summarize and term as runtime uncertainty. Such uncertainty cannot be learned from the logged data due to its abnormality and rareness nature. To assert a certain level of robustness, we perturb the off-policy estimators along an adversarial direction in view of the runtime uncertainty. It allows the resulting estimators to be robust not only to observed but also unexpected runtime uncertainties. Leveraging this idea, we bring runtime-uncertainty robustness to three major off-policy learning methods: the inverse propensity score method, reward-model method, and doubly robust method. We theoretically justify the robustness of our methods to runtime uncertainty, and demonstrate their effectiveness using both the simulation and the real-world online experiments.",
