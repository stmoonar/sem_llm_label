            "abstract": "Over recent years, news recommender systems have gained significant attention in both academia and industry, emphasizing the need for a standardized benchmark to evaluate and compare the performance of these systems. Concurrently, Green AI advocates for reducing the energy consumption and environmental impact of machine learning. To address these concerns, we introduce the first Green AI benchmarking framework for news recommendation, known as GreenRec, and propose a metric for assessing the tradeoff between recommendation accuracy and efficiency. Our benchmark encompasses 30 base models and their variants, covering traditional end-to-end training paradigms as well as our proposed efficient only-encode-once (OLEO) paradigm. Through experiments consuming 2000 GPU hours, we observe that the OLEO paradigm achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end paradigms and delivers up to a 2992% improvement in sustainability metrics.",

            "title": "Modeling User Attention in Music Recommendation",
            "abstract": "With the popularity of online music services, personalized music recommendation has garnered much research interest. Recommendation models are typically trained on datasets constructed from user feedback, which includes both the active feedback (e.g., clicking the Like or Skip buttons) and passive feedback (e.g., auto-play), with passive feedback comprising the majority. Due to the unavailability of user attention, the massive amount of passive feedback is unreliable, significantly compromising the quality of the training data. How to estimate the user's attention on the target music has become a critical problem in music recommendation. Heuristic methods such as exponential decay and negative sampling have been proposed. However, they either neglect the sequential dependencies between feedback actions or utilize only a small fraction of passive samples, leading to inaccurate and biased attention estimation. In this paper, we naturally propose modeling user attention prediction as a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning problem, where active feedback is treated as positive samples and passive feedback is treated as unlabeled samples, as we can only ensure that the user's attention is focused when she provides active feedback. Then we propose an extended PU-learning model with sequential dependencies, called UAE, which contains an unbiased user attention estimator and an unbiased propensity estimator. Subsequently, a joint learning algorithm is developed in which the attention and propensity estimators are optimized in alternating fashion. Theoretical analysis shows the unbiasedness and variance of the attention estimator and the propensity estimator. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate the proposed UAE's effectiveness and generality in enhancing downstream music recommendation. One week online A/B testing on Huawei Music App manifests that UAE can significantly increase the users' play count and time over 2%, further demonstrating the effectiveness of UAE in real-world music recommendation products.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems have a significant impact on various real-world applications, shaping people's daily lives and enhancing productivity. Traditional recommender models aim to collect extensive user information to accurately estimate user preferences. However, in practical scenarios, users may not want all their behaviors to be included in the model training process. This paper introduces a novel recommendation paradigm that allows users to indicate their ``willingness'' regarding which data should contribute to model training. The models are then optimized to maximize utility, which considers the trade-off between recommendation performance and respecting user preferences. The recommendation problem is formulated as a multiplayer game, with each user acting as a player and using a selection vector to indicate their willingness to include specific interacted items in training. To efficiently solve this game, an influence function-based model is proposed to approximate recommendation performances for different actions without re-optimizing the model. Furthermore, an enhanced model leveraging multiple anchor actions for the influence function is introduced to improve performance approximation accuracy. The convergence rate of the algorithm is theoretically analyzed, and the advantages of incorporating multiple anchor actions are demonstrated. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed models in balancing recommendation quality and user willingness. To promote this research direction, we have released our project at https://paitesanshi.github.io/IFRQE/.",

            "abstract": "Personalized recommendation serves as a ubiquitous channel for users to discover information tailored to their interests. However, traditional recommendation models primarily rely on unique IDs and categorical features for user-item matching, potentially overlooking the nuanced essence of raw item contents across multiple modalities such as text, image, audio, and video. This underutilization of multimodal data poses a limitation to recommender systems, especially in multimedia services like news, music, and short-video platforms. The recent advancements in large multimodal models offer new opportunities and challenges in developing content-aware recommender systems. This survey seeks to provide a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements and future trajectories in multimodal pretraining, adaptation, and generation techniques, as well as their applications in enhancing recommender systems. Furthermore, we discuss current open challenges and opportunities for future research in this dynamic domain. We believe that this survey, alongside the curated resources, will provide valuable insights to inspire further advancements in this evolving landscape.",

In this paper, we study a novel problem in the field of explainable recommendation, that is, \u201cgiven a limited budget to incentivize users to provide behavior explanations, how to effectively collect data such that the downstream models can be better optimized?\u201d To solve this problem, we propose an active learning framework for recommender system, which consists of an acquisition function for sample collection and an explainable recommendation model to provide the final results.

            "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) based agents have recently attracted much attention from the research and industry communities. Compared with original LLMs, LLM-based agents are featured in their self-evolving capability, which is the basis for solving real-world problems that need long-term and complex agent-environment interactions. The key component to support agent-environment interactions is the memory of the agents. While previous studies have proposed many promising memory mechanisms, they are scattered in different papers, and there lacks a systematical review to summarize and compare these works from a holistic perspective, failing to abstract common and effective designing patterns for inspiring future studies. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive survey on the memory mechanism of LLM-based agents. In specific, we first discuss ''what is'' and ''why do we need'' the memory in LLM-based agents. Then, we systematically review previous studies on how to design and evaluate the memory module. In addition, we also present many agent applications, where the memory module plays an important role. At last, we analyze the limitations of existing work and show important future directions.

However, there still lacks an objective and automatic evaluation on their memory capability, largely due to the challenges in constructing reliable questions and answers (QAs) according to user messages. In this paper, we propose MemSim, a Bayesian simulator designed to automatically construct reliable QAs from generated user messages, simultaneously keeping their diversity and scalability. Specifically, we introduce the Bayesian Relation Network (BRNet) and a causal generation mechanism to mitigate the impact of LLM hallucinations on factual information, facilitating the automatic creation of an evaluation dataset. Based on MemSim, we generate a dataset in the daily-life scenario, named MemDaily, and conduct extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of our approach. We also provide a benchmark for evaluating different memory mechanisms in LLM-based agents with the MemDaily dataset.

            "title": "FINAL: Factorized Interaction Layer for CTR Prediction",
            "abstract": "Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) serves as a core component in many deep models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction. However, vanilla MLP networks are inefficient in learning multiplicative feature interactions, making feature interaction learning an essential topic for CTR prediction. Existing feature interaction networks are effective in complementing the learning of MLPs, but they often fall short of the performance of MLPs when applied alone. Thus, their integration with MLP networks is necessary to achieve improved performance. This situation motivates us to explore a better alternative to the MLP backbone that could potentially replace MLPs. Inspired by factorization machines, in this paper, we propose FINAL, a factorized interaction layer that extends the widely-used linear layer and is capable of learning 2nd-order feature interactions. Similar to MLPs, multiple FINAL layers can be stacked into a FINAL block, yielding feature interactions with an exponential degree growth. We unify feature interactions and MLPs into a single FINAL block and empirically show its effectiveness as a replacement for the MLP block. Furthermore, we explore the ensemble of two FINAL blocks as an enhanced two-stream CTR model, setting a new state-of-the-art on open benchmark datasets. FINAL can be easily adopted as a building block and has achieved business metric gains in multiple applications at Huawei. Our source code will be made available at MindSpore/models and FuxiCTR/model_zoo.",

            "title": "Robust Causal Inference for Recommender System to Overcome Noisy Confounders",
            "abstract": "Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating causal inference into recommender systems to answer the hypothetical question: \"what would be the potential feedback when a user is recommended a product?\" Various unbiased estimators, including Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) and Doubly Robust (DR), have been proposed to address this question. However, these estimators often assume that confounders are precisely observable, which is not always the case in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called Adversarial Training-based IPS (AT-IPS), which uses adversarial training to handle noisy confounders. The proposed method defines a feasible region for the confounders, obtains the worst-case noise (adversarial noise) within the region, and jointly trains the propensity model and the prediction model against such noise to improve their robustness. We provide a theoretical analysis of the accuracy-robustness tradeoff of AT-IPS and demonstrate its superior performance compared to other popular estimators on both real-world and semi-synthetic datasets.",

            "title": "Only Encode Once: Making Content-based News Recommender Greener",
            "abstract": "Large pretrained language models (PLM) have become de facto news encoders in modern news recommender systems, due to their strong ability in comprehending textual content. These huge Transformer-based architectures, when finetuned on recommendation tasks, can greatly improve news recommendation performance. However, the PLM-based pretrain-finetune framework incurs high computational cost and energy consumption, primarily due to the extensive redundant processing of news encoding during each training epoch. In this paper, we propose the ``Only Encode Once'' framework for news recommendation (OLEO), by decoupling news representation learning from downstream recommendation task learning. The decoupled design makes content-based news recommender as green and efficient as id-based ones, leading to great reduction in computational cost and training resources. Extensive experiments show that our OLEO framework can reduce carbon emissions by up to 13 times compared with the state-of-the-art pretrain-finetune framework and maintain a competitive or even superior performance level.
