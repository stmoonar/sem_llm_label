            "abstract": "By sharing complementary perceptual information, multi-agent collaborative perception fosters a deeper understanding of the environment. Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception. The source code will be made available.",

            "title": "EdgeCooper: Network-Aware Cooperative LiDAR Perception for Enhanced Vehicular Awareness",
            "abstract": "Autonomous driving vehicle (ADV) that is ready to transform our society and economy, is in desperate need of precise positioning over itself as well as surrounding environments. However, it is still a challenging issue for ADV to retrieve real-time positioning knowledge over road participants and dynamic surrounding environments, due to unsatisfied perception accuracy caused by sparse observations and limited perception range. Cooperative perception, which advocates cooperatively disseminating perception data among vehicles, has the potential to overcome the above limitations. To this end, this article proposes a novel edge-assisted multi-vehicle perception system to enhance vehicles\u2019 awareness over surrounding environments, which is termed as EdgeCooper. EdgeCooper first schedules vehicles to share complementarity-enhanced and redundancy-minimized raw sensor data with an edge server, using multi-hop cooperative 5G V2X communications. Then, EdgeCooper merges vehicles\u2019 individual views to form a holistic view with a higher resolution, thus enhancing perception robustness and enlarging perception range. We formulate multi-vehicle multi-hop cooperative data sharing as a minimum cost flow problem with conflict, and further prove that there exists no polynomial-time approximation algorithm with a constant performance ratio unless P = NP. Furthermore, a two-dimension graph coloring algorithm with guaranteed performance is proposed to eliminate conflict. We evaluate EdgeCooper by building a comprehensive simulation platform through a joint manipulation of SUMO, CARLA, NS3, and PyTorch. The experiment results show that, compared to a single vehicle\u2019s perception, EdgeCooper performs effective and efficient in enhancing vehicular awareness, e.g., extending up to 3.6 times detection range and improving perception accuracy by 20%.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a masked and sparse transformer to address the problem of point cloud registration with low overlap. The mask mechanism reduces the overall data, increasing the corresponding point ratio in the overlap region, while also reducing the computational cost to accelerate the algorithm's execution speed. Moreover, we combine spatial position encoding and sparse self-attention to establish relationships within the source point cloud, as well as the relationships and attention scores between the source and target point clouds. This approach is specifically designed for the task of point cloud registration. Finally, we search for the maximum overlap area by matching the spatial consistency between points and calculate the 3D transformation matrix to complete the registration process. Our method achieves an improvement in the inlier ratio and performs well on the 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch datasets, demonstrating high registration efficiency.",

Christian Gerdes are the three most productive and influential authors at IEEE TIV, and the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National University of Defense Technology, and the University of California, are three most productive and influential institutions. In addition, three networks are generated (i.e., the co-authorship, co-keyword, and author-keyword) to mine collaboration patterns among authors and keywords. Collaboration relationship between researchers and hot research topics are also investigated. Furthermore, an open-source tool is developed to automatically collect metadata, perform bibliographic analysis, and mine collaboration patterns.",

            "abstract": "Traffic prediction is a keystone for building smart cities in the new era and has found wide applications in traffic scheduling and management, environment policy making, public safety, and so on. Instead of creating a traffic predictor for each city, this article focuses on designing a unified network model that could be directly applied for traffic prediction in any city, by learning the essential spatial\u2013temporal dependencies, i.e., the mutual relationship between traffic and the corresponding fine-grained road network. To achieve this goal, this article proposes a joint knowledge- and data-driven mechanism that novelly divides dependencies into three kinds of correlations, i.e., road segment, intra-intersection, and inter-intersection correlation, which capture the microcosmic, middle, and macroscopic dependencies between traffic and the road network, respectively. Specifically, we first construct traffic datasets that could cover all road segments from real-world trajectory datasets, which makes it possible to model the whole road network as a graph, with the help of fine-grained road topology. Then, we propose meta road segment learner, connection-aware spatial\u2013temporal graph convolutional network (GCN), and multiscale residual networks for capturing the microcosmic, middle, and macroscopic dependencies, respectively. Our experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method could: 1) achieve better prediction accuracy compared with several approaches and 2) capture the mutual relationship between traffic and the fine-grained road network since our model trained only using data from the source city achieves good performance when it is directly applied for traffic prediction in the target city, without any fine-tuning. The codes will be made publicly available.",

            "abstract": "The potential of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to reduce on-board system costs in autonomous vehicles through shared intelligence is considerable. However, it still faces significant challenges, including concerns over data breaches and privacy, inefficiencies and limited fault tolerance in centralized management, and the challenge of ensuring data accuracy. This letter marks the inaugural report from a series of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) Trustworthy IoV Workshops, which aim to address these issues. In these workshops, we explore the concept of a decentralized IoV (DeIoV), underpinned by decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs), to facilitate trustworthy interactions between vehicles and other entities. The proposed DeIoV is structured in two layers: the local DAO layer and the global DAO layer. This dual-layer architecture distinguishes between real-time and non-real-time decision-making tasks, aiding in their efficient completion. To ensure data security, integrity, and accuracy, we employ blockchain technology and smart contracts, which allow for mutual verification among adjacent members and utilize encryption algorithms. A reputation value-based voting mechanism for decision-making is also introduced, which helps prevent the monopolization of power through token-based systems, a common issue in traditional DAOs. Ultimately, we believe that DeIoV has the potential to create a trustworthy IoV ecosystem, contributing significantly to safe, secure, and collaborative autonomous driving.",

While RIS technology holds significant potential for improving connectivity in IoV and vehicle settings, its fixed configuration falls short in meeting the dynamic demands in IoV. To address the diverse requirements of IoV services, including stringent safety norms, societal acceptance, and cost efficiency, this article proposes a parallel surfaces system to facilitate service-oriented V2X communications for autonomous vehicles. By harnessing artificial models of the physical RIS-assisted IoV system, conducting extensive computational experiments, and parallel execution, the proposed system enables real-time monitoring, predictive analysis, and optimization. Parallel intelligence empowers efficient and adaptable channel estimation, configuration, and energy management, thereby establishing a more intelligent and secure RIS-assisted IoV infrastructure. In addition, the parallel surfaces system encompasses descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive intelligence in IoV for addressing coverage gaps, enabling hotspot offloading, facilitating multiple antenna signal transmission, and enhancing high-precision positioning.",

            "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the growing popularity of connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and attention mechanism in scene text recognition (STR). CTC-based methods consume less time with few computational burdens, while they are not as effective as attention-based methods. To retain computational efficiency and effectiveness, we propose the global\u2013local attention-augmented light Transformer (GLaLT), which adopts a Transformer-based encoder\u2013decoder structure to orchestrate CTC and attention mechanism. The encoder integrates the self-attention module with the convolution module to augment the attention, where the self-attention module pays more attention to capturing long-term global dependencies and the convolution module focuses on local context modeling. The decoder consists of two parallel modules: one is the Transformer-decoder-based attention module and the other is the CTC module. The first one is removed in the testing phase and can guide the second one to extract robust features in the training phase. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that GLaLT achieves state-of-the-art performance for both regular and irregular STR. In terms of tradeoffs, the proposed GLaLT is at or near the frontiers for maximizing speed, accuracy, and computational efficiency at the same time.",

            "abstract": "This letter reports on a TIV DHW (decentralized and hybrid workshop) that explores the prospective influence of ChatGPT on research and development in intelligent vehicles. To assess the update capabilities of ChatGPT, we conducted tests involving both basic and technically relevant questions. Our preliminary testing revealed that ChatGPT's information can be updated and corrected at one time, but it may take some time for the changes to be reflected in ChatGPT's responses, so it may not always possess the latest knowledge regarding specific topics. We further discuss the prospective influence of ChatGPT on the field of intelligent vehicles, particularly possible applications of ChatGPT in areas like autonomous driving, human-vehicle interaction, and intelligent transportation systems, highlighting challenges and opportunities associated with these applications. Additionally, we address technical questions, such as the feasibility of training intelligent vehicles using the same methods as ChatGPT and the reflection of the intelligence of intelligent vehicles in the context of human-machine shared control. In conclusion, this letter presents a preliminary exploration of the potential of ChatGPT for intelligent vehicle research, from an IEEE TIV perspective, acknowledging the limitations and uncertainties of this emerging technology.",

            "title": "HierCoop: Hierarchical Cooperative Resource Allocation for Vehicular Communications in Heterogeneous Networks",
            "abstract": "Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) can provide intelligent vehicles with high-bandwidth access and support large-scale vehicle-infrastructure cooperation. However, the spectrum allocation of HetNets faces the problem of mutual coupling between macrocell base station (MBS) and intensively deployed small-cell base stations (SBSs) which share spectrum band. While recent research has used Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) to allocate resources for vehicle-infrastructure cooperation, it has focused solely on intra-cell resource distribution, overlooking inter-cell resource cooperation. Inter-cell resource cooperation in HetN ets faces significant communication overhead due to real-time link state interaction between base stations. Additionally, timely updates to inter-cell resource allocation policies are critical when vehicular communication patterns undergo shifts. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical cooperative resource allocation method (HierCoop) for addressing the aforementioned challenges in vehicular communications in HetN ets. Each base station is modeled as an agent with hierarchical structure which combines coarse-grained inter-cell collaboration policies and fine-grained inner-cell resource allocation. Specifically, the upper layer of each agent is deployed centrally, thus enabling inter-cell collaboration policies to be based on the abstract channel state features extracted from the lower layers instead of the original channel state information. Meanwhile, the lower layer of each agent is deployed locally in base station, which executes actual resource allocation action based on the policy formulated by the upper layer. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCoop can significantly enhances spectral efficiency and communication quality.",
