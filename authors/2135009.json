            "title": "SSANet: An Adaptive Spectral-Spatial Attention Autoencoder Network for Hyperspectral Unmixing",
            "abstract": "Convolutional neural-network-based autoencoders, which can integrate the spatial correlation between pixels well, have been broadly used for hyperspectral unmixing and obtained excellent performance. Nevertheless, these methods are hindered in their performance by the fact that they treat all spectral bands and spatial information equally in the unmixing procedure. In this article, we propose an adaptive spectral\u2013spatial attention autoencoder network, called SSANet, to solve the mixing pixel problem of the hyperspectral image. First, we design an adaptive spectral\u2013spatial attention module, which refines spectral\u2013spatial features by sequentially superimposing the spectral attention module and spatial attention module. The spectral attention module is built to select useful spectral bands, and the spatial attention module is designed to filter spatial information. Second, SSANet exploits the geometric properties of endmembers in the hyperspectral image while considering abundance sparsity. We significantly improve the endmember and abundance results by introducing minimum volume and sparsity regularization terms into the loss function. We evaluate the proposed SSANet on one synthetic dataset and four real hyperspectral scenes, i.e., Samson, Jasper Ridge, Houston, and Urban. The results indicate that the proposed SSANet achieved competitive unmixing results compared with several conventional and advanced unmixing approaches with respect to the root mean square error and spectral angle distance.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing image fusion is a fundamental issue in the field of remote sensing. In this paper, we propose a remote sensing image fusion method based on optimal scale morphological convolutional neural networks (CNN) using the principle of entropy from information theory. We use an attentional CNN to fuse the optimal cartoon and texture components of the original images to obtain a high-resolution multispectral image. We obtain the cartoon and texture components using sparse decomposition-morphological component analysis (MCA) with an optimal threshold value determined by calculating the information entropy of the fused image. In the sparse decomposition process, the local discrete cosine transform dictionary and the curvelet transform dictionary compose the MCA dictionary. We sparsely decompose the original remote sensing images into a texture component and a cartoon component at an optimal scale using the information entropy to control the dictionary parameter. Experimental results show that the remote sensing image fusion method proposed in this paper can effectively retain the information of the original image, improve the spatial resolution and spectral fidelity, and provide a new idea for image fusion from the perspective of multi-morphological deep learning.",

This method effectively mitigates the curse of dimensionality for hyperspectral images (HSIs). First, we use the hyperspectral full-band data to train a custom 1-D CNN to obtain a well-trained model. Second, we select band combinations based on DD. Using the rectified linear unit, which is the activation function of the CNN that is only activated with a nonzero value, we can effectively test the band combinations without retraining the model. Finally, the method selects the band combinations with the highest precision as the final selected bands. This precision measure is a new criterion for band selection. To further improve the performance, a data augmentation method based on DD is also proposed. To justify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on two HSIs. The results show that the proposed method can acquire more satisfactory results than traditional methods.",
