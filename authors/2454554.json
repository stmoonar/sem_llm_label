            "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges in interactive visual exploration of large multi-variate time series data. Traditional data reduction techniques may improve latency but can distort visualizations. State-of-the-art methods aimed at 100% accurate visualization often fail to maintain interactive response times or require excessive preprocessing and additional storage. We propose an in-memory adaptive caching approach, MinMaxCache, that efficiently reuses previous query results to accelerate visualization performance within accuracy constraints. MinMaxCache fetches data at adaptively determined aggregation granularities to maintain interactive response times and generate approximate visualizations with accuracy guarantees. Our results show that it is up to 10 times faster than current solutions without significant accuracy compromise.",

            "abstract": "How can we adapt the composition of a post over a series of rounds to make it more appealing in a social network? Techniques that progressively learn how to make a fixed post more influential over rounds have been studied in the context of the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, which seeks a set of seed users that maximize a post\u2019s influence. However, there is no work on progressively learning how a post\u2019s features affect its influence. In this article, we propose and study the problem of Adaptive Content-Aware Influence Maximization (ACAIM), which calls to find k features to form a post in each round so as to maximize the cumulative influence of those posts over all rounds. We solve ACAIM by applying, for the first time, an Online Learning to Rank (OLR) framework for IM purposes. We introduce the CATRID propagation model, which expresses how posts disseminate in a social network using click probabilities and post visibility criteria and develop a simulator that runs CATRID via a training-testing scheme based on real posts of the VK social network, so as to realistically represent the learning environment. We deploy three learners that solve ACAIM in an online (real-time) manner. We experimentally prove the practical suitability of our solutions via exhaustive experiments on multiple brands (operating as different case studies) and several VK datasets; the best learner is evaluated on 45 separate case studies yielding convincing results.",

            "abstract": "Soiling is the accumulation of dirt in solar panels that leads to a decreasing trend in solar energy yield and may be the cause of vast revenue losses. The effect of soiling can be reduced by washing the panels, which is, however, a procedure of non-negligible cost. Moreover, soiling monitoring systems are often unreliable or very costly. We study the problem of estimating the soiling ratio in photovoltaic (PV) modules, i.e., the ratio of the real power output to the power output that would be produced if solar panels were clean. A key advantage of our algorithms is that they estimate soiling, without needing to train on labeled data, i.e., periods of explicitly monitoring the soiling in each park, and without relying on generic analytical formulas that do not take into account the peculiarities of each installation. We consider as input a time series comprising a minimum set of measurements that are available to most PV park operators. Our experimental evaluation shows that we significantly outperform current state-of-the-art methods for estimating soiling ratio.",

Inspired by recent work on indexing non-point objects for range queries, we propose a secondary partitioning scheme for space-partitioning indices, tailored to NN search. Our scheme classifies the contents of each primary partition into 16 secondary partitions, considering the begin and end of objects with respect to the spatial extent of the primary partition. Based on this, we design algorithms for both incremental NN and k-NN search that avoid duplicate results and skip unnecessary computations. We compare our scheme to the state-of-the-art indexing and find that it has a significant performance advantage.",

We study the problem of indexing non-point objects in memory for range queries and spatial intersection joins. We propose a secondary partitioning technique for space-oriented partitioning indices (e.g., grids), which improves their performance significantly, by avoiding the generation and elimination of duplicate results. Our approach is easy to implement and can be used by any space-partitioning index to significantly reduce the cost of range queries and intersection joins. In addition, the secondary partitions can be processed independently, which makes our method appropriate for distributed and parallel indexing. Experiments on real datasets confirm the advantage of our approach against alternative duplicate elimination techniques and data-oriented state-of-the-art spatial indices. We also show that our partitioning technique, paired with optimized partition-to-partition join algorithms, typically reduces the cost of spatial joins by around 50%.",

Consequently, applications that require accurate short-term forecasts and predictions are also steadily increasing. In this paper, we provide an overview of a novel end-to-end platform that provides efficient ingestion, compression, transfer, query processing, and machine learning-based analytics for high-frequency and high-volume time series from IoT. The performance of the platform is evaluated using real-world dataset from RES installations. The results show the importance of high-frequency analytics and the surprisingly positive impact of error bounded lossy compression on machine learning in the form of AutoML. For example, when detecting yaw misalignments in wind turbines, an improvement of 9% in accuracy was observed for AutoML models on lossy compressed data compared to the current industry standard of 10-minute aggregated data. Thus, these small-scale experiments show the potential of the platform, and larger pilots are planned.",

            "title": "A Content Recommendation Policy for Gaining Subscribers",
            "abstract": "How can we recommend content for a brand agent to use over a series of rounds so as to gain new subscribers to its social network page? The Influence Maximization (IM) problem seeks a set of~k users, and its content-aware variants seek a set of~k post features, that achieve, in both cases, an objective of expected influence in a social network. However, apart from raw influence, it is also relevant to study gain in subscribers, as long-term success rests on the subscribers of a brand page; classic IM may select~k users from the subscriber set, and content-aware IM starts the post's propagation from that subscriber set. In this paper, we propose a novel content recommendation policy to a brand agent for Gaining Subscribers by Messaging (GSM) over many rounds. In each round, the brand agent messages a fixed number of social network users and invites them to visit the brand page aiming to gain their subscription, while its most recently published content consists of features that intensely attract the preferences of the invited users. To solve GSM, we find, in each round, which content features to publish and which users to notify aiming to maximize the cumulative subscription gain over all rounds. We deploy three GSM solvers, named \\sR, \\sSC, and \\sSU, and we experimentally evaluate their performance based on VKontakte (VK) posts by considering different user sets and feature sets. Our experimental results show that \\sSU provides the best solution, as it is significantly more efficient than \\sSC with a minor loss of efficacy and clearly more efficacious than \\sR with competitive efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Non-point spatial objects (e.g., polygons, linestrings, etc.) are ubiquitous and their effective management is always timely. We study the problem of indexing non-point objects in memory. We propose a secondary partitioning technique for space-oriented partitioning indices (e.g., grids), which improves their performance significantly, by avoiding the generation and elimination of duplicate results. Our approach is novel and of a high impact, as (i) it is extremely easy to implement and (ii) it can be used by any space-partitioning index. We show how our approach can be used to boost the performance of spatial range queries. We also show how we can avoid performing the expensive refinement step of a range query for the majority of objects and study the efficient processing of numerous queries in batch and in parallel. Extensive experiments on real datasets confirm the superiority of space-oriented partitioning over data-oriented partitioning and the advantage of our approach against alternative duplicate elimination techniques.",

            "title": "A Two-level Spatial In-Memory Index",
            "abstract": "Very large volumes of spatial data increasingly become available and demand effective management. While there has been decades of research on spatial data management, few works consider the current state of commodity hardware, having relatively large memory and the ability of parallel multi-core processing. In this work, we re-consider the design of spatial indexing under this new reality. Specifically, we propose a main-memory indexing approach for objects with spatial extent, which is based on a classic regular space partitioning into disjoint tiles. The novelty of our index is that the contents of each tile are further partitioned into four classes. This second-level partitioning not only reduces the number of comparisons required to compute the results, but also avoids the generation and elimination of duplicate results, which is an inherent problem of spatial indexes based on disjoint space partitioning. The spatial partitions defined by our indexing scheme are totally independent, facilitating effortless parallel evaluation, as no synchronization or communication between the partitions is necessary. We show how our index can be used to efficiently process spatial range queries and drastically reduce the cost of the refinement step of the queries. In addition, we study the efficient processing of numerous range queries in batch and in parallel. Extensive experiments on real datasets confirm the efficiency of our approaches.",
