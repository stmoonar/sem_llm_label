            "abstract": "Recently, the wanton dissemination of fake news on social media has adversely affected our lives, rendering automatic fake news detection a pressing issue. Current methods are often fully supervised and typically employ deep neural networks (DNN) to learn implicit relevance from labeled data, ignoring explicitly shared properties (e.g., inflammatory expressions) across fake news. To address this limitation, we propose a graph-theoretic framework, called Generalized Deep Markov Random Fields Framework (GDMRFF), that inherits the capability of deep learning while at the same time exploiting the correlations among the news articles (including labeled and unlabeled data). Specifically, we first leverage a DNN-based module to learn implicit relations, which we then reveal as the unary function of MRF. Pairwise functions with refining effects to encapsulate human insights are designed to capture the explicit association among all samples. Meanwhile, an event removal module is introduced to remove event impact on pairwise functions. Note that we train GDMRFF with the semi-supervised setting, which decreases the reliance on labeled data while maximizing the potential of unlabeled data. We further develop an Ambiguity Learning Guided MRF (ALGM) model as a concretization of GDMRFF. Experiments show that ALGM outperforms the compared methods significantly on two datasets, especially when labeled data is limited.",

            "abstract": "Recently, progress has been made towards improving automatic sarcasm detection in computer science. Among existing models, manually constructing static graphs for texts and then using graph neural networks (GNNs) is one of the most effective approaches for drawing long-range incongruity patterns. However, the manually constructed graph structure might be prone to errors (e.g., noisy or incomplete) and not optimal for the sarcasm detection task. Errors produced during the graph construction step cannot be remedied and may accrue to the following stages, resulting in poor performance. To surmount the above limitations, we explore a novel Iterative Augmenting Affective Graph and Dependency Graph (IAAD) framework to jointly and iteratively learn the incongruity graph structure. IAAD can alternatively update the incongruity graph structure and node representation until the learning graph structure is optimal for the metrics of sarcasm detection. More concretely, we begin with deriving an affective and a dependency graph for each instance, then an iterative incongruity graph learning module is employed to augment affective and dependency graphs for obtaining the optimal inconsistent semantic graph with the goal of optimizing the graph for the sarcasm detection task. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for sarcasm detection with significant margins.",

            "abstract": "Traffic prediction is an important component of the intelligent transportation system. Existing deep learning methods encode temporal information and spatial information separately or iteratively. However, the spatial and temporal information is highly correlated in a traffic network, so existing methods may not learn the complex spatial-temporal dependencies hidden in the traffic network due to the decomposed model design. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new model named Trafformer, which unifies spatial and temporal information in one transformer-style model. Trafformer enables every node at every timestamp interact with every other node in every other timestamp in just one step in the spatial-temporal correlation matrix. This design enables Trafformer to catch complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Following the same design principle, we use the generative style decoder to predict multiple timestamps in only one forward operation instead of the iterative style decoder in Transformer. Furthermore, to reduce the complexity brought about by the huge spatial-temporal self-attention matrix, we also propose two variants of Trafformer to further improve the training and inference speed without losing much effectivity. Extensive experiments on two traffic datasets demonstrate that Trafformer outperforms existing methods and provides a promising future direction for the spatial-temporal traffic prediction problem.",

            "abstract": "Sarcasm is widely utilized on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit. Sarcasm detection is required for analyzing people's true feelings since sarcasm is commonly used to portray a reversed emotion opposing the literal meaning. The syntactic structure is the key to make better use of commonsense when detecting sarcasm. However, it is extremely challenging to effectively and explicitly explore the information implied in syntactic structure and commonsense simultaneously. In this paper, we apply the pre-trained COMET model to generate relevant commonsense knowledge, and explore a novel scenario of constructing a commonsense-augmented sentiment graph and a commonsense-replaced dependency graph for each text. Based on this, a Commonsense Sentiment Dependency Graph Convolutional Network (CSDGCN) framework is proposed to explicitly depict the role of external commonsense and inconsistent expressions over the context for sarcasm detection by interactively modeling the sentiment and dependency information. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets reveal that our proposed method beats the state-of-the-art methods in sarcasm detection, and has a stronger interpretability.",

            "abstract": "Traffic forecasting is one canonical example of spatial-temporal learning task in Intelligent Traffic System. Existing approaches capture spatial dependency with a pre-determined matrix in graph convolution neural operators. However, the explicit graph structure losses some hidden representations of relationships among nodes. Furthermore, traditional graph convolution neural operators cannot aggregate long-range nodes on the graph. To overcome these limits, we propose a novel network, Spatial-Temporal Adaptive graph convolution with Attention Network (STAAN) for traffic forecasting. Firstly, we adopt an adaptive dependency matrix instead of using a pre-defined matrix during GCN processing to infer the inter-dependencies among nodes. Secondly, we integrate PW-attention based on graph attention network which is designed for global dependency, and GCN as spatial block. What's more, a stacked dilated 1D convolution, with efficiency in long-term prediction, is adopted in our temporal block for capturing the different time series. We evaluate our STAAN on two real-world datasets, and experiments validate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",
