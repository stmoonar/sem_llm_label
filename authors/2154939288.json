            "abstract": "Multi-modal data have recently been utilized to improve the performance of knowledge graph completion (KGC), attracting widespread research interest. However, they have been ignored in few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC), which aims to discover potential facts involving unseen relations that only appear in few-shot triples. The most relevant FKGC study simply concatenates various modal features, but the performance is still limited due to the following problems: (1) lack of exploiting significant multi-modal features in neighborhoods, and (2) ineffectively modeling inter-modal interactions in a few-shot setting. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel relational learning model entitled MMSN (Multi-Modal Siamese Network) for few-shot knowledge graph completion, which is composed of the following two primary modules: the Siamese multi-modal neighbor encoder (SMNE) and the meta-learning multi-modal knowledge representation decoder (MKRD). The module SMNE is developed to encode diverse modalities of neighbors by a Siamese attention network, fuse multi-modal information through a gating fusion network, and learn effective relational embeddings using an aggregator. The module MKRD is introduced to handle inter-modal interactions between multiple modalities and train the proposed model in a few-shot scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model MMSN outperforms the state-of-the-art FKGC models, including uni-modal and multi-modal models, on two real-world few-shot multi-modal datasets.",

            "abstract": "Inductive Link Prediction (ILP) aims to predict links for unseen entities in emerging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), where a more realistic scenario is that unseen entities do not emerge all at once but emerge sequentially in multiple stages. Unfortunately, existing studies neglect the sequential-emerging nature of KGs and simplify this scenario into multi-batch unseen entities emerging simultaneously. Subsequently, two problems arise and restrict the performance of existing methods: (1) lack of the capability to model the long-dependency interactions between entities across different stages; (2) unable to exploit the incremental characteristics when KGs emerge in sequence. To address the problems effectively, we dive into the practical scenario formulated as Sequential-emerging Knowledge Graphs (SEKGs), and propose a novel model entitled ISE2 (Inductive Sequential Emerging Embedding). Specifically, ISE2 is composed of the following two modules: (1) a relational graph-transformer network is designed to capture long-dependency interactions with the full-graph receptive field; (2) an adaptive attention mechanism is developed to iteratively integrate emerging KGs into a whole, fully utilizing the incremental characteristic in SEKGs. Furthermore, a new benchmark that conforms to the data distribution of real-world sequential-emerging is constructed. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ISE2 compared with the state-of-the-art methods in SEKGs scenario.",

            "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-hop reasoning has become an interpretable way for knowledge graph reasoning owing to its persuasive explanations for the predicted results, but the reasoning performance of these methods drops significantly over few-shot relations (only contain few triplets). To address this problem, recent studies introduce meta-learning into RL-based reasoning methods. However, the performance of these studies is still limited due to the following points: (1) the overall reasoning accuracy is impaired due to the low reasoning accuracies over some hard relations; (2) the reasoning process becomes laborious and ineffective owing to the existence of noisy data; (3) the generalizability is negatively affected due to the lack of knowledge-sharing. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel model HMLS consisting of two modules HHML (Hierarchical Hardness-aware Meta-reinforcement Learning) and HHS (Hierarchical Hardness-aware Sampling). Specifically, HHML contains the following two components: (1) a hardness-aware RL conducts multi-hop reasoning by training hardness-aware batches and reducing noise; (2) a knowledge-sharing meta-learning adapts to few-shot relations by exploiting common features in the hierarchical relation structure. The other module HHS generates hardness-aware batches from relation and relation-cluster levels. The experimental results demonstrate that this work notably outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in few-shot scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) with real-world facts are vital for various downstream applications. However, the incomplete nature of KGs has brought lots of problems to them, and probing missing facts via reasoning or forecasting has become a promising solution. Different from the traditional KG reasoning focusing on static facts, temporal knowledge graph (TKG) forecasting incorporating time information presents more potential in event prediction, as many facts are dynamic in real-world. Despite the significance of TKG forecasting, the following inevitable problems bring great challenges for it. (1) How to alleviate the problem of temporal fact redundancy in the TKG? (2) How to merge the useful fragmented temporal facts for the given query throughout the TKG? To overcome these problems effectively, we propose a novel model entitled TKGF-NTP, which consists of two components. (1) A structural encoder is developed to aggregate the most valuable structural information and filter out the redundant temporal facts from each TKG snapshot. (2) A temporal encoder is designed to capture the evolutions of entities, while the self-attention mechanism is employed to capture the most crucial temporal information throughout the TKG. The effectiveness of TKGF-NTP is evaluated on four public datasets via link prediction, and the results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "With the popularity of modern mobile devices and GPS technology, big web stream data with location are continuously generated and collected. The sequential positions form a trajectory, and the clustering analysis on trajectories is beneficial to a wide range of applications, e.g., route recommendation. In the past decades, extensive efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of static trajectory clustering. However, trajectory stream data is received incrementally, and the continuous trajectory clustering inevitably faces the following two problems: (1) physical structure design for trajectory representation leads to severe space overhead, and (2) dynamic maintenance of trajectory semantics and its retrieval structure brings intensive computation. To overcome the above problems, an adaptive continuous trajectory clustering framework (ACTOR) is proposed in this paper. Overall, it covers three key components: (1) Simplifier represents trajectory with a well-designed PT structure. (2) Partitioner utilizes a hexagonal-based indexing strategy to enhance the local computational efficiency. (3) Executor accommodates an adaptive selection of P-clustering and R-clustering approaches according to the ROC (rate of change) matrix. Empirical studies on real-world data validate the usefulness of our proposal and prove the huge advantage of our approach over available solutions in the literature.",

            "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) model the temporal evolution of events and have recently attracted increasing attention. Since TKGs are intrinsically incomplete, it is necessary to reason out missing elements. Although existing TKG reasoning methods have the ability to predict missing future events, they fail to generate explicit reasoning paths and lack explainability. As reinforcement learning (RL) for multi-hop reasoning on traditional knowledge graphs starts showing superior explainability and performance in recent advances, it has opened up opportunities for exploring RL techniques on TKG reasoning. However, the performance of RL-based TKG reasoning methods is limited due to: (1) lack of ability to capture temporal evolution and semantic dependence jointly; (2) excessive reliance on manually designed rewards. To overcome these challenges, we propose an adaptive reinforcement learning model based on attention mechanism (DREAM) to predict missing elements in the future. Specifically, the model contains two components: (1) a multi-faceted attention representation learning method that captures semantic dependence and temporal evolution jointly; (2) an adaptive RL framework that conducts multi-hop reasoning by adaptively learning the reward functions.

However, the reasoning performance of these methods is limited due to the following problems: (1) ineffective fusion of multi-modal auxiliary features; (2) lack of complex reasoning ability as well as inability to conduct the multi-hop reasoning which is able to infer more missing knowledge.

            "title": "Location prediction for facility placement by incorporating multi-characteristic information",
            "abstract": "In the course of recommending locations for establishing new facilities on urban planning or commercial programming, the location prediction offers the optimal candidates, which maximizes the number of served customers or minimize customer inconvenience, therefore brings the maximum profits. In most existing studies, only the spatial-temporal features are recognized to evaluate the location popularity, where social relationships of customers, which are significant factors for popularity assessing, have been ignored. Additionally, current researches also fail to take capacities and categories of the facilities into consideration. To overcome the drawbacks, we introduce a novel model of Multi-characteristic Information based Top-k Location Prediction (MITLP), it captures the spatio-temporal behaviors of customers based on historical trajectories, exploits the social relevancy from their friend relationships, as well as examines the category competitiveness of specific facilities thoroughly. Subsequently, by drawing on the feature evaluation and popularity quantization, MITLP will be implemented within a hybrid B-tree-liked recommending framework, Constrained Location and Social-Trajectory Clustered forest (CLSTC-forest), which can not only produce better performance in practice but also address the facility service constraints. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the higher efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model.",

            "title": "Intention-oriented Hierarchical Bundle Recommendation with Preference Transfer",
            "abstract": "Bundle recommendation offers promotions of bundled items instead of a single one, which is a common strategy for sales revenue increase and latent customer mining. Due to the scarcity of user-bundle interactions, it is compulsory to go beyond modeling user-bundle interactions and take user-item interactions into account. Existing studies consider user-item interactions by sharing model parameters or learning representation in a multi-task manner or modeling representation based on graph neural network. However, such methods ignore the mutual influence between user preferences for items and bundles. Moreover, they fail to analyse the intentions behind users' purchase behaviors, which can be utilized to make better bundle recommendation. To overcome the drawbacks of existing studies, we propose a novel model IHBR (Intention-oriented Hierarchical Bundle Recommendation with Preference Transfer). Specifically, we consider the co-purchase and co-occurrence information within items for modeling intention-oriented hierarchical representations. Furthermore, we provide a new perspective to exploit mutual influence between user preferences for items and bundles. The experimental results obtained on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",
