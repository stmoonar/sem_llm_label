            "title": "Improving Distinguishability of Class for Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received widespread attention and applications due to their excellent performance in graph representation learning. Most existing GNNs can only aggregate 1-hop neighbors in a GNN layer, so they usually stack multiple GNN layers to obtain more information from larger neighborhoods. However, many studies have shown that model performance experiences a significant degradation with the increase of GNN layers. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of distinguishability of class to indirectly evaluate the learned node representations, and verify the positive correlation between distinguishability of class and model performance. Then, we propose a Graph Neural Network guided by Distinguishability of class (Disc-GNN) to monitor the representation learning, so as to learn better node representations and improve model performance. Specifically, we first perform inter-layer filtering and initial compensation based on Local Distinguishability of Class (LDC) in each layer, so that the learned node representations have the ability to distinguish different classes. Furthermore, we add a regularization term based on Global Distinguishability of Class (GDC) to achieve global optimization of model performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets have shown that the competitive performance of Disc-GNN to the state-of-the-art methods on node classification and node clustering tasks.",

            "title": "A New Mechanism for Eliminating Implicit Conflict in Graph Contrastive Learning",
            "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention because it can self-supervisedly extract low-dimensional representation of graph data. InfoNCE-based loss function is widely used in graph contrastive learning, which pulls the representations of positive pairs close to each other and pulls the representations of negative pairs away from each other. Recent works mainly focus on designing new augmentation methods or sampling strategies. However, we argue that the widely used InfoNCE-based methods may contain an implicit conflict which seriously confuses models when learning from negative pairs. This conflict is engendered by the encoder's message-passing mechanism and the InfoNCE loss function. As a result, the learned representations between negative samples cannot be far away from each other, compromising the model performance. To our best knowledge, this is the first time to report and analysis this conflict of GCL. To address this problem, we propose a simple but effective method called Partial ignored Graph Contrastive Learning (PiGCL). Specifically, PiGCL first dynamically captures the conflicts during training by detecting the gradient of representation similarities. It then enables the loss function to ignore the conflict, allowing the encoder to adaptively learn the ignored information without self-supervised samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",
