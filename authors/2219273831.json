            "title": "Vague Preference Policy Learning for Conversational Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) commonly assume users have clear preferences, leading to potential over-filtering of relevant alternatives. However, users often exhibit vague, non-binary preferences. We introduce the Vague Preference Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (VPMCR) scenario, employing a soft estimation mechanism to accommodate users' vague and dynamic preferences while mitigating over-filtering. In VPMCR, we propose Vague Preference Policy Learning (VPPL), consisting of Ambiguity-aware Soft Estimation (ASE) and Dynamism-aware Policy Learning (DPL). ASE captures preference vagueness by estimating scores for clicked and non-clicked options, using a choice-based approach and time-aware preference decay. DPL leverages ASE's preference distribution to guide the conversation and adapt to preference changes for recommendations or attribute queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate VPPL's effectiveness within VPMCR, outperforming existing methods and setting a new benchmark. Our work advances CRS by accommodating users' inherent ambiguity and relative decision-making processes, improving real-world applicability.",

            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) effectively address information asymmetry by dynamically eliciting user preferences through multi-turn interactions. Existing CRS widely assumes that users have clear preferences, i.e., users have a firm belief about the fine-grained preference for one or multiple target items. Under this assumption, the agent will completely trust the user feedback and treat the accepted or rejected signals as strong indicators to filter items and reduce the candidate space, which may lead to the problem of over-filtering. However, in reality, users\u2019 preferences are often vague and volatile, with uncertainty about their desires and changing decisions during interactions. To address this issue, we introduce a novel scenario called Vague Preference Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (VPMCR), whichconsidersusers\u2019vagueandvolatilepreferencesinCRS.VPMCR employsasoftestimationmechanismtoassignanon-zeroconfi-dencescoreforallcandidateitemstobedisplayed,naturallyavoid-ingtheover-filteringproblem.IntheVPMCRsetting,weintro-duceansolutioncalledAdaptiveVaguePreferencePolicyLearning (AVPPL),whichconsistsoftwomaincomponents:Uncertainty-awareSoftEstimation(USE)andUncertainty-awarePolicyLearn-ing(UPL).USEestimatestheuncertaintyofusers\u2019vaguefeedback andcapturestheirdynamicpreferencesusingachoice-basedprefer-encesextractionmoduleandatime-awaredecayingstrategy.UPL leveragesthepreferencedistributionestimatedbyUSEtoguidethe conversationandadapttochangesinusers\u2019preferencestomake recommendationsoraskforattributes.
