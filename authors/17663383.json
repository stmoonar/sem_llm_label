            "abstract": "Modern systems and applications generate and consume an enormous amount of data from different sources, including mobile edge computing and IoT systems. Our ability to locate and analyze these massive amounts of data will shape the future, building next-generation Big Data Analytics (BDA) and artificial intelligence systems in critical domains. Traditionally, big data materialize in a centralized repository (e.g., the cloud) for running sophisticated analytics using decent computation. Nevertheless, many modern applications and critical domains require low-latency data analysis with the right decision at the right time standard for building trust. With the advent of edge computing, that traditional deployment model shifted closer to the data sources at the network\u2019s edge. Such a shift was motivated by minimized latency, increased uptime, and enhanced efficiencies. This paper studies the BDA building blocks, analyzes the deployment requirements for edge-based BDA QoS, and drafts future trends. It also discusses critical open issues and further research directions for the next step of edge-based BDA.",

            "abstract": "Software quality is critical, as low quality, or \u201cCode smell,\u201d increases technical debt and maintenance costs. There is a timely need for a collaborative model that detects and manages code smells by learning from diverse and distributed data sources while respecting privacy and providing a scalable solution for continuously integrating new patterns and practices in code quality management. However, the current literature is still missing such capabilities. This paper addresses the previous challenges by proposing a Federated Learning Code Smell Detection (FedCSD) approach, specifically targeting \u201cGod Class,\u201d to enable organizations to train distributed ML models while safeguarding data privacy collaboratively. We conduct experiments using manually validated datasets to detect and analyze code smell scenarios to validate our approach. Experiment 1, a centralized training experiment, revealed varying accuracies across datasets, with dataset two achieving the lowest accuracy (92.30%) and datasets one and three achieving the highest (98.90% and 99.5%, respectively). Experiment 2, focusing on cross-evaluation, showed a significant drop in accuracy (lowest: 63.80%) when fewer smells were present in the training dataset, reflecting technical debt. Experiment 3 involved splitting the dataset across 10 companies, resulting in a global model accuracy of 98.34%, comparable to the centralized model\u2019s highest accuracy. The application of federated ML techniques demonstrates promising performance improvements in code-smell detection, benefiting both software developers and researchers.",

            "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving machine learning (ML) and distributed systems realm, the escalating concern for data privacy naturally comes to the forefront of discussions. Federated learning (FL) emerges as a pivotal technology capable of addressing the inherent issues of centralized data privacy. However, FL architectures with centralized orchestration are still vulnerable, especially in the aggregation phase. A malicious server can exploit the aggregation process to learn about participants' data. This study proposes MPCFL, a secure FL algorithm based on secure multi-party computation (MPC) and secret sharing. The proposed algorithm leverages the Sharemind MPC framework to aggregate local model updates for securely formulating a global model. MPCFL provides practical mitigation of trending FL concerns, e.g., inference attack, gradient leakage attack, model poisoning, and model inversion. The algorithm is evaluated on several benchmark datasets and shows promising results. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is viable for developing secure and privacy-preserving FL applications, significantly improving all performance metrics while maintaining security and reliability. This investigation is a precursor to deeper explorations to craft robust FL aggregation algorithms.",

            "abstract": "genome Sequence Alignment Map The rapidly increasing demand for next-generation biotechnologies has enabled the development of DNA and RNA big data-oriented (BD) pipelines. The preprocessing stage requires sequencing and alignment tools that provide barcoding for error correction and increase accuracy during sequencing. Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) promise a highly accurate bioinformatic identification of PCR duplication before the amplification stage. However, using alignment coordinates alone is Data-intensiveand challenging due to the increased demand for computational throughput, affecting the performance of the underlying resources. This paper proposes a highly scalable data scheduling and resource allocation framework called OPERA-gSAM for the genome Sequence Alignment Map (SAM). OPERA-gSAM, an OPportunistic and Elastic Resource Allocation, is an enabling big data platform (i.e., Apache Spark) for the next-generation massively parallel sequencing applications. We validate OPERA-gSAM scalability and efficiency using Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing. Our experiments demonstrate the usability and high efficiency of the proposed framework. Results show that OPERA-gSAM is up to 2.4\u00d7 faster while consuming 50% fewer resources than the conventional pipeline using SAM and UMI tools.",

This study presents a structured survey of cutting-edge techniques for handling the Non-IID data, accompanied by proposing a metric to develop a standardized approach for assessing data skew and its harmony with the appropriate approach. The findings affirm the metric's suitability as a heuristic for assessing data skew in distributed datasets without having insight into client data, serving both scientific and practical purposes and thus supporting the selection of handling strategies.

Utilizing cutting-edge scientific workflows can robustly address these challenges. This paper presents a Spark-based alignment workflow called SparkFlow for massive NGS analysis over singularity containers. SparkFlow is highly scalable, reproducible, and capable of parallelizing computation by utilizing data-level parallelism and load balancing techniques in HPC and Cloud environments. The proposed workflow capitalizes on benchmarking two state-of-art NGS workflows, i.e., Base Recalibrator and ApplyBQSR. SparkFlow realizes the ability to accelerate large-scale cancer genomic analysis by scaling vertically (HyperThreading) and horizontally (provisions on-demand). Our result demonstrates a trade-off inevitably between the targeted applications and proces-sor architecture. SparkFlow achieves a decisive improvement in NGS computation performance, throughput, and scalability while maintaining deployment complexity.

            "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) systems are complex systems that can manage mission-critical, costly operations or the collection, storage, and processing of sensitive data. Therefore, security represents a primary concern that should be considered when engineering IoT systems. Additionally, several challenges need to be addressed, including the following ones. IoT systems\u2019 environments are dynamic and uncertain. For instance, IoT devices can be mobile or might run out of batteries, so they can become suddenly unavailable. To cope with such environments, IoT systems can be engineered as goal-driven and self-adaptive systems. A goal-driven IoT system is composed of a dynamic set of IoT devices and services that temporarily connect and cooperate to achieve a specific goal. Several approaches have been proposed to engineer goal-driven and self-adaptive IoT systems. However, none of the existing approaches enable goal-driven IoT systems to automatically detect security threats and autonomously adapt to mitigate them. Toward bridging these gaps, this paper proposes a distributed architectural Approach for engineering goal-driven IoT Systems that can autonomously SElf-adapt to secuRity Threats in their environments (ASSERT). ASSERT exploits techniques and adopts notions, such as agents, federated learning, feedback loops, and blockchain, for maintaining the systems\u2019 security and enhancing the trustworthiness of the adaptations they perform. The results of the experiments that we conducted to validate the approach\u2019s feasibility show that it performs and scales well when detecting security threats, performing autonomous security adaptations to mitigate the threats and enabling systems\u2019 constituents to learn about security threats in their environments collaboratively.",

            "title": "FLIoDT: A Federated Learning Architecture from Privacy by Design to Privacy by Default over IoT",
            "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) realized exponential growth of smart devices with decent capabilities, promising an era of Edge Intelligence. This paradigm creates a timely need to shift many computations closer to the data source at the network's edge. Data privacy is paramount, as security breaches can severely impact such an environment with its vast attack surface. The advent of Federated learning (FL), a privacy-by-design with decentralized machine learning (ML), enables participants to collaboratively train a model without sharing their sensitive data. Nevertheless, privacy implications are a glaring concern and perrier for widening the utilization of FL approaches and their mass adoption over IoT applications. This paper introduces the notion of FL over the Internet of Disconnected Things (FLIoDT), a functionality separation of concerns following the air-gapped networks. FLIoDT provides a practical methodology to mitigate Data threats/attacks in the FL domain. FLIoDT proves a practical architectural approach to mitigate several attacks in an Edge environment. Data dredging and adversarial attacks, like data poisoning, to name some. This study investigates human activity recognition of health monitoring patient data over edge computing to validate FLIoDT.",
