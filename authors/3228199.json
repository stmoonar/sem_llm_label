            "abstract": "Motivated by the desire to explore the process of combining inductive and deductive reasoning, we conducted a systematic literature review of articles that investigate the integration of machine learning and ontologies. The objective was to identify diverse techniques that incorporate both inductive reasoning (performed by machine learning) and deductive reasoning (performed by ontologies) into artificial intelligence systems. Our review, which included the analysis of 128 studies, allowed us to identify three main categories of hybridization between machine learning and ontologies: learning-enhanced ontologies, semantic data mining, and learning and reasoning systems. We provide a comprehensive examination of all these categories, emphasizing the various machine learning algorithms utilized in the studies. Furthermore, we compared our classification with similar recent work in the field of hybrid AI and neuro-symbolic approaches.",

The recent development of IOT and efficient big data processing has been shown to provide purposeful issue to permanent monitoring during the entire wine making process. Standing within this trend, we introduce in this paper an intelligent system for vineyards monitoring in the Burgundy region. The main trust of the proposed system relies on the use of the Swrl rules in WineCloud ontology. The design of the ontology is mainly based on information gathered from interviews with wine growers. In addition, sensor data is also collected and used to feed the ontology after being processed. The system is used in the aim to have better grape quality with an improved vineyard management. To do so, association rules are extracted from the collected data aiming to provide useful knowledge to forecast vine diseases.",

            "abstract": "Wine Cloud project is the first \"Big Data\" platform on the french viticulture value chain. The aim of this platform is to provide a complete traceability of the life cycle of the wine, from the wine-grower to the consumer. In particular, Wine Cloud may qualify as an agricultural decision platform that will be used for vine life cycle management in order to predict the occurrence of major risks (vine diseases, grape vine pests, physiological risks, fermentation stoppage, oxidation of vine, etc...). Also to make wine production more rational by offering winegrower a set of recommendation regarding their strategy's of production development. The proposed platform \"Wine Cloud\" is based on heterogeneous sensors network (agricultural machines, plant sensors and measuring stations) deployed throughout a vineyard. These sensors allow for capturing data from the agricultural process and remote monitoring vineyards in the Internet of Things (IoT) era. However, the sensors data from different source is hard to work together for lack of semantic. Therefore, the task of coherently combining heterogeneous sensors data becomes very challenging. The integration of heterogeneous data from sensors can be achieved by data mining algorithms able to build correlations. Nevertheless, the meaning and the value of these correlations is difficult to perceive without highlighting the meaning of the data and the semantic description of the measured environment. In order to bridge this gap and build causality relationships form heterogeneous sensor data, we propose an ontology-based approach, that consists in exploring heterogeneous sensor data (light, temperature, atmospheric pressure, etc) in terms of ontologies enriched with semantic meta-data describing the life cycle of the monitored environment.",

Once information has a well-defined meaning, it can be searched and retrieved more effectively. Therefore, this paper is a survey about the methods that compare different textual information sources in order to determine whether they address a similar information or not. The improvement of the studied methods will eventually lead to increase the efficiency of documentary research. In order to achieve this goal, the first category of methods focuses on semantic measure definitions. A second category of methods focuses on paraphrase identification techniques, and the last category deals with improving event extraction techniques. A general discussion is given at the end of the paper presenting the advantages and disadvantages of these methods.",

Analysis methods that extract information about the content of the images are very promising for this purpose. In this paper, a method that automatically extract the brand of objects in images is proposed. The method does not explicitly search for text or logos. This information is implicitly included in the Bag-of-Words representation. In the Bag-of-Words paradigm, visual features are clustered to create the visual words. Despite its shortcomings, k-means is the most widely used algorithm. With k-means, the selection of the number of visual words is critical. In this paper, another clustering algorithm is proposed. Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) is very fast, does not require an arbitrary selection of the number of classes and does not rely on random initialization. First, we demonstrate in this paper that MCL is competitive to k-means with a number of cluster experimentally selected. Second, we show that it is possible to identify brand from objects in images without previous knowledge about visual identity of these brands.",

More precisely, it focuses on automatic profile refinement of customers which is an important task over time by taken into account logs of the user concerning especially his/her actions, reading time, and domain specific knowledge. In our approach, ontologies are used to describe and automatically refine these profiles. This work focuses on one particular type of recommender systems which is content-based recommenders. The aim of these recommender systems is to build a user profile and to improve its precision over time. Several improvements that have been made to these recommender systems over the last decade are analyzed. We find that the improvements brought by the use of semantic knowledge are not negligible, therefore semantic web approaches should be more and more used in the future. Nevertheless improvements remain possible in this domain and further research could be interesting.",

Its objectives are threefold: (i) automatically multi-classify the economic new articles, (ii) recommend the articles by comparing the profiles of the users and the multi-classification of the articles, and (iii) managing the vocabulary of the economic news domain to improve the system based on the seamlessly intervention of the documentalists. In this paper we focus on the automatic multi-classification of the articles and the respective description and justification to the documentalists. While several multi-classification solutions exist they are not automatically adaptable to the problem in hands as their description of the resulting multi-classification lacks substantial correlation with the documentalists perspective. In fact, we need to consider not only the automatic classification but also the supervision of the classification and its evolution based on the documentalists supervision of the automatic classification. Accordingly, it is necessary to provide a mechanism that bridges the gap between the automatic classification mechanisms and the documentalists thesaurus, in order to support their seamless supervision of classification and of thesaurus management. Ontologies are central to our proposal, as they are used to represent and manage the thesaurus, to describe the content of the articles, and finally to automatically multi-classify them via inference process. Also, we adopt a machine learning approach for generating a prediction model for supporting the automatic classification. This paper presents a proposal for enriching the documentalist-oriented ontology with the model prediction rules, which provides the necessary capabilities to the DL reasoner for automatic multi-classification.",

            "abstract": "Mining frequent patterns is an essential task in discovering hidden correlations in datasets. Although frequent patterns unveil valuable information, there are some challenges which limits their usability. First, the number of possible patterns is often very large which hinders their eff ective exploration. Second, patterns with many items are hard to read and the analyst may be unable to understand their meaning. In addition, the only available information about patterns is their support, a very coarse piece of information. In this paper, we are particularly interested in mining datasets that reflect usage patterns of users moving in space and time and for whom demographics attributes are available (age, occupation, etc). Such characteristics are typical of data collected from smart phones, whose analysis has critical business applications nowadays. We propose pattern exploration primitives, abstraction and refinement, that use hand-crafted taxonomies on time, space and user demographics. We show on two real datasets, Nokia and MovieLens, how the use of such taxonomies reduces the size of the pattern space and how demographics enable their semantic exploration. This work opens new perspectives in the semantic exploration of frequent patterns that reflect the behavior of di fferent user communities.",

            "abstract": "Increasing complexity in both the software and the underlying hardware, and ever tighter time-to-market pressures are some of the key challenges faced when designing multimedia embedded systems. Optimizing the debugging phase can help to reduce development time significantly. A powerful approach used extensively during this phase is the analysis of execution traces. However, huge trace volumes make manual trace analysis unmanageable. In such situations, Data Mining can help by automatically discovering interesting patterns in large amounts of data. In this paper, we are interested in discovering periodic behaviors in multimedia applications. Therefore, we propose a new pattern mining approach for automatically discovering all periodic patterns occurring in a multimedia application execution trace.\n Furthermore, gaps in the periodicity are of special interest since they can correspond to cracks or drop-outs in the stream. Existing periodic pattern definitions are too restrictive regarding the size of the gaps in the periodicity. So, in this paper, we specify a new definition of frequent periodic patterns that removes this limitation. Moreover, in order to simplify the analysis of the set of frequent periodic patterns we propose two complementary approaches: (a) a lossless representation that reduces the size of the set and facilitates its analysis, and (b) a tool to identify pairs of \"competitors\" where a pattern breaks the periodicity of another pattern. Several experiments were carried out on embedded video and audio decoding application traces, demonstrating that using these new patterns it is possible to identify abnormal behaviors.",
