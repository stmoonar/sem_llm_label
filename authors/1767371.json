            "title": "FAIR Research Object Assessment: A landscape analysis",
            "abstract": ". Research Objects (ROs) are becoming a popular means to capture the context and research artefacts associated with a research investigation in both human-readable and machine-readable formats. However, it is unclear how well ROs themselves adhere to the FAIR (find-able, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles. In this work, we describe a comprehensive analysis of the FAIR assessment of more than 2500 ROs across multiple disciplines. Our work integrates FAIROs, our existing RO evaluation service, in the ROHub platform. We discuss the challenges of calculating the FAIR assessment of aggregations of resources, and how we supplement the FAIROs tests with information from the RO-Crate descriptor file generated by ROHub.",

            "abstract": "In large scale production and scientific, academic environments, the information sets to perform computations on come from various sources. In particular, some computations may require the information obtained as a result of previous computations. Workflow description offers an attractive approach to formally deal with such complex processes. Vine Toolkit solution addresses some major challenges here such as the synchronization of distributed workflows, establishing a community driven grid environment for the seamless results sharing and collaboration. In order to accomplish these goals Vine Toolkit offers integration on different layers starting from rich user interface web components embedded in portal frameworks like GridSphere or Liferay , integration with workflow engine and grid security and ending up with a built-in meta-scheduling mechanisms, that allow IT administrators to perform load balancing automatically among computing clusters and data centers to meet peak demands. As a result of the wow2green project a complete solution has been developed and delivered and still is being adopted in the pending projects like PL-Grid .",

            "abstract": "Web portals are one of the possible ways to access the remote computing resources offered by Grid environments. Since the emergence of the first middleware for the Grid, works have been conducted on delivering the functionality of Grid services on the Web. Many interesting Grid portal solutions have been designed help organize remote access to Grid resources and applications from within Web browsers. They are technically advanced and more and more widely used around the world, resulting in feedback from the community. Some of these user comments concern the flexibility and user\u2010friendliness of the developed solutions. In this paper we present how we addressed the need for a flexible and user\u2010friendly Grid portal environment within the PROGRESS project and how our approach facilitates the use of the Grid within Web portals.

            "title": "Plugging grids into computing portals: the PROGRESS grid resource broker plug\u2010in mechanism",
            "abstract": "The grid research that has been intensely undertaken in the recent years has resulted in a long list of excellent solutions for the access to and utilization of powerful remote computing resources. Some of these solutions have emerged into standards or good practices widely accepted by the grid community. However, a lot of other important standards are yet to be found and the range of available middleware, protocols and services causes not only a serious problem when deciding on the technology to be used for a particular grid environment, but also poses a major challenge when trying to solve some ongoing issues. The lack of standards and heterogeneity of the grid middleware used is, for example, a big challenge when designing science gateways that are set to provide the scientific community with means of accessing the vast amount of the powerful grid resources delivered by multiple independent grid infrastructures administered by different types of grid management systems. In this paper, we present a method by which we addressed this problem within the PROGRESS project and how it resulted in the design of the grid resource broker plug\u2010in mechanism, which allows the enabling of resources belonging to heterogeneous grid infrastructures within a computing portal.
