            "abstract": "The rapid expansion of the digital world has propelled sentiment analysis into a critical tool across diverse sectors such as marketing, politics, customer service, and healthcare. While there have been significant advancements in sentiment analysis for widely spoken languages, low-resource languages, such as Bangla, remain largely under-researched due to resource constraints. Furthermore, the recent unprecedented performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications highlights the need to evaluate them in the context of low-resource languages. In this study, we present a sizeable manually annotated dataset encompassing 33,606 Bangla news tweets and Facebook comments. We also investigate zero- and few-shot in-context learning with several language models, including Flan-T5, GPT-4, and Bloomz, offering a comparative analysis against fine-tuned models. Our findings suggest that monolingual transformer-based models consistently outperform other models, even in zero and few-shot scenarios. To foster continued exploration, we intend to make this dataset and our research tools publicly available to the broader research community.",

            "abstract": "One of the main causes of structural damage to the building is vibration. By detecting early vibration through digital technology, many losses and accidents can be reduced. This design prototype shows the implementation process of the ADXL-345 Accelerometer and Arduino based vibration analysis. The prototype consists of ADXL-345 Accelerometer, Arduino mega, Wi-Fi module, LCD display. It performs the following functions like measuring vibration and also analyzing the overall vibration as well as compare with the standard device from the correctness side. Here the system is going to use four ADXL-345 Triple-Axis Accelerometer which senses the vibration of the object and sends this data to Arduino. By the Wi-Fi module, the data which is collected from the Accelerometer is inspected. This device makes the data analysis easier and gives accurate results. Even the resultant data can be transmitted on a personal server which is a very helpful way. This work gives focus to show the causes for vibration controlling and to find out the impulse movement that gives proper specification about the machinery situation and how much it affects the structure. So, to maintain the machinery, vibration observing is a much-needed part of this established era.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of Blue-tooth Low Energy-based scanning systems wherein the objective is to successfully scan all items of a group of a prescribed size within a prescribed scanning period at a prescribed probability of success, for example, less than one failure in one million. We show that a design based upon independence among collision events fails to achieve the target reliability objectives by roughly an order of magnitude. Our analysis, which is verified through extensive simulation, shows that correlation among the collision events has a major impact upon the scanning time required to successfully scan all the members of a group.",

            "abstract": "The main objective of this research work is to develop a vehicle that will be assisted with solar energy and will identify the location of victims in the earthquake-affected areas. This car will be operated in surveillance areas and off-road areas by controlling both manually and automatically. When it finds any victim then it detects the latitude and longitude point of the detected victim in the online map. The vehicle has a Xiaomi wireless action camera to show the victim's location. NRF module is used to transmit data and a joystick module is used as a controller module. Arduino takes the command as a user pushes the button of the joystick, then data is transmitted through NRF at the receiving end. There is an LCD display also set with the joystick which can show the command that has already sent or received by NRF. An L298 motor driver is used to operate a motor by power storage. The surveillance vehicle is run on different road conditions to observe its speed variations and it turns out that its performance is the best in the smooth road surface as usual and the worst performance is achieved in the hilly road condition. Though in smooth road conditions higher speed is achieved, power consumption is quite same for both smooth and off-road conditions.",
