            "abstract": "While many existing graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proven to perform $\\ell_2$-based graph smoothing that enforces smoothness globally, in this work we aim to further enhance the local smoothness adaptivity of GNNs via $\\ell_1$-based graph smoothing. As a result, we introduce a family of GNNs (Elastic GNNs) based on $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$-based graph smoothing. In particular, we propose a novel and general message passing scheme into GNNs. This message passing algorithm is not only friendly to back-propagation training but also achieves the desired smoothing properties with a theoretical convergence guarantee. Experiments on semi-supervised learning tasks demonstrate that the proposed Elastic GNNs obtain better adaptivity on benchmark datasets and are significantly robust to graph adversarial attacks. The implementation of Elastic GNNs is available at \\url{https://github.com/lxiaorui/ElasticGNN}.",

            "abstract": "Organizations or individuals often have an incentive to target a certain number of agents to launch a contagion process effectively and efficiently, for example, sampling consumers in the diffusion of new products. We present an effective strategy for contagion in scale-free networks. The proposed strategy, hub strategy, calls for targeting mostly the highly connected nodes. The biased level implemented in this strategy characterizes its ability to identify hub nodes. We demonstrate that hub strategy can improve the contagion effects evidently. We find that biased level increases first with heterogeneity level of contagion network but decreases with that after a certain value, and decreases with initial adopter rate all the time. Moreover, degree correlations in contagion networks may reduce biased level.",
