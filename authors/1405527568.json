            "title": "A Common Framework for Developing Table Understanding Models",
            "abstract": "A wealth of knowledge is contained in tabular data, and there are a vast number of efforts to model and capture this knowledge. Unfortunately, these efforts have disparate inputs, outputs, and goals hindering research progress and making table understanding tools difficult to use in practice. In this paper, we propose a table understanding framework that formalizes the problem of understanding tabular data into three distinct subtasks: cell classification, block detection, and relation prediction. We introduce a common API for table understanding systems that supports a host of existing approaches and allows easy development of new approaches. Our framework supports approaches that range from heuristic rules to probabilistic models, allows outputs that span simple, correlational tuples to sophisticated, semantic knowledge graphs, and provides tools for visualizing model outputs and transforming complex tabular data into flattened relational dataframes.",

            "abstract": "There is a large amount of data on the web in tabular form, such as excel sheets, CSVs, and web tables. Often, tabular data is meant for human consumption, using data layouts that are difficult for machines to interpret automatically. Previous work uses the stylistic features of tabular cells (e.g. font size, border type, background color) to classify tabular cells by their role in the data layout of the document (top attribute, data, metadata, etc.). In this paper, we propose a method to embed the semantic and contextual information about tabular cells in a low dimension cell embedding space. We then propose an RNN-based classification technique to use these cell vector representations, combining them with stylistic features introduced in previous work, in order to improve the performance of cell type classification in complex documents. We evaluate the performance of our system on three datasets containing documents with various data layouts, in two settings, in-domain, and cross-domain training. Our evaluation result shows that our proposed cell vector representations in combination with our RNN-based classification technique significantly improves cell type classification performance.",

            "abstract": "There are hundreds of millions of tables in Web pages that contain useful information for many applications. Leveraging data within these tables is difficult because of the wide variety of structures, formats and data encoded in these tables. TabVec is an unsupervised method to embed tables into a vector space to support classification of tables into categories (entity, relational, matrix, list, and non-data) with minimal user intervention. TabVec deploys syntax and semantics of table cells, and embeds the structure of tables in a table vector space. This enables superior classification of tables even in the absence of domain annotations. Our evaluations in four real world domains show that TabVec improves classification accuracy by more than 20% compared to three state of the art systems, and that those systems require significant in domain training to achieve good results.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces ThermTap, which enables system and software developers to monitor the power consumption and temperature of various hardware components in an Android device as a function of running applications and processes. ThermTap comprises of a power analyzer, called PowerTap, and an online thermal simulator, called Therminator 2. With accurate power macro-models, PowerTap collates activity profiles of major components of a portable device from the OS kernel device drivers in an event-driven manner to generate power traces. In turn, Therminator 2 reads these traces and, using a compact thermal model of the device, generates various temperature maps including those for the device components and device skin. Fast thermal simulation techniques enable Therminator 2 to be executed in realtime. With precise per-process and per-application temperature maps that ThermTap produces, it enables software and system developers to find thermal bugs in their software. A case study is presented on identifying a thermal bug in the software running on an Android device.",

            "abstract": "FinFET device has been proposed as a promising substitute for the traditional bulk CMOS-based device at the nanoscale, due to its extraordinary properties such as improved channel controllability, high ON/OFF current ratio, reduced short-channel effects, and relative immunity to gate line-edge roughness. In addition, the near-ideal subthreshold behavior indicates the potential application of FinFET circuits in the near-threshold supply voltage regime, which consumes an order of magnitude less energy than the regular strong-inversion circuits operating in the super-threshold supply voltage regime. This paper presents a design flow of creating standard cells by using the FinFET 5nm technology node, including both near-threshold and super-threshold operations, and building a Liberty-format standard cell library. The circuit synthesis results of various combinational and sequential circuits based on the 5nm FinFET standard cell library show up to 40X circuit speed improvement and three orders of magnitude energy reduction compared to those of 45nm bulk CMOS technology.",

            "abstract": "Considering the growing number of Internet and cloud computing data centers in operation today and the high, yet flexible\u00b7 data center electric load, data centers can be good candidates to offer ancillary services and respond to regulation signals in a smart grid This paper considers a problem whereby the smart grid employs both day-ahead dynamic energy prices and regulation signals to incentivize (cloud) data centers to simultaneously reduce their energy consumptions and participate in an ancillary service market A data center controller schedules task dispatch and performs resource allocation in order to minimize the overall cost, which is the total electricity cost based on time-of-use energy prices minus any monetary compensations that data center may receive due to offering ancillary services. Moreover, the data center must satisfy average latency requirements in processing requests as specified in service-level agreements with clients. A two-tier hierarchical solution is presented for the data center controller, which achieves optimality in minimizing the overall cost with polynomial time complexity. Experimental results on Google trace demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in minimizing the overall cost in the data center.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decades, Redundant Array of independent Disks (RAIDs) have been configured based on mechanical characteristics of Hard Disk Drives (HDDs). With the advent of Solid-State Drives (SSDs), such configurations such as stripe unit size can be far from the characteristics of SSDs. In this paper, we investigate the effect of stripe unit size on the endurance and the overall I/O performance of an SSD-based RAID array and compare the optimal stripe unit size with the suggested stripe unit sizes for HDD-based RAID. To this end, we first examine the number of extra page reads and writes imposed by write requests and then observe the corresponding impact on the overall throughput and the average response time of SSD-based RAID arrays. The effect of extra page writes for different stripe unit sizes and their impact on endurance has been also examined. To validate the analytical study, we have used I/O intensive traces and simulated an SSD-based RAID array using DiskSim simulator with different stripe unit sizes. The experimental results reveal that unlike HDD-based RAID arrays, a 4KB stripe unit size can significantly improve the throughput, response time, and endurance of an SSD-based RAID4 array (up to 67.6%, 52.2%, and 48.6%, respectively) as compared to 128KB stripe unit size.",
