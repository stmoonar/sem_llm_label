            "abstract": "Forecasting of geopolitical events is a notoriously difficult task, with experts failing to significantly outperform a random baseline across many types of forecasting events. One successful way to increase the performance of forecasting tasks is to turn to crowdsourcing: leveraging many forecasts from non-expert users. Simultaneously, advances in machine learning have led to models that can produce reasonable, although not perfect, forecasts for many tasks. Recent efforts have shown that forecasts can be further improved by ``hybridizing'' human forecasters: pairing them with the machine models in an effort to combine the unique advantages of both. In this demonstration, we present Synergistic Anticipation of Geopolitical Events (SAGE), a platform for human/computer interaction that facilitates human reasoning with machine models.",

            "abstract": "Ransomware, a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim's files and only releases the cryptographic key once a ransom is paid, has emerged as a potentially devastating class of cybercrimes in the past few years. In this paper, we present RAPTOR, a promising line of defense against ransomware attacks. RAPTOR fingerprints attackers' operations to forecast ransomware activity. More specifically, our method learns features of malicious domains by looking at examples of domains involved in known ransomware attacks, and then monitors newly registered domains to identify potentially malicious ones. In addition, RAPTOR uses time series forecasting techniques to learn models of historical ransomware activity and then leverages malicious domain registrations as an external signal to forecast future ransomware activity. We illustrate RAPTOR's effectiveness by forecasting all activity stages of Cerber, a popular ransomware family. By monitoring zone files of the top-level domain .top starting from August 30, 2016 through May 31, 2017, RAPTOR predicted 2,126 newly registered domains to be potential Cerber domains. Of these, 378 later actually appeared in blacklists. Our empirical evaluation results show that using predicted domain registrations helped improve forecasts of future Cerber activity. Most importantly, our approach demonstrates the value of fusing different signals in forecasting applications in the cyber domain.",

            "abstract": "Cyber attacks are growing in frequency and severity. Over the past year alone we have witnessed massive data breaches that stole personal information of millions of people and wide-scale ransomware attacks that paralyzed critical infrastructure of several countries. Combating the rising cyber threat calls for a multi-pronged strategy, which includes predicting when these attacks will occur. The intuition driving our approach is this: during the planning and preparation stages, hackers leave digital traces of their activities on both the surface web and dark web in the form of discussions on platforms like hacker forums, social media, blogs and the like. These data provide predictive signals that allow anticipating cyber attacks. In this paper, we describe machine learning techniques based on deep neural networks and autoregressive time series models that leverage external signals from publicly available Web sources to forecast cyber attacks. Performance of our framework across ground truth data over real-world forecasting tasks shows that our methods yield a significant lift or increase of F1 for the top signals on predicted cyber attacks. Our results suggest that, when deployed, our system will be able to provide an effective line of defense against various types of targeted cyber attacks.",
