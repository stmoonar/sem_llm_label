            "abstract": "This study investigates game-based learning in the context of the educational game\"Jo Wilder and the Capitol Case,\"focusing on predicting student performance using various machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Random Forest. The research aims to identify the features most predictive of student performance and correct question answering. By leveraging gameplay data, we establish complete benchmarks for these models and explore the importance of applying proper data aggregation methods. By compressing all numeric data to min/max/mean/sum and categorical data to first, last, count, and nunique, we reduced the size of the original training data from 4.6 GB to 48 MB of preprocessed training data, maintaining high F1 scores and accuracy. Our findings suggest that proper preprocessing techniques can be vital in enhancing the performance of non-deep-learning-based models. The MLP model outperformed the current state-of-the-art French Touch model, achieving an F-1 score of 0.83 and an accuracy of 0.74, suggesting its suitability for this dataset. Future research should explore using larger datasets, other preprocessing techniques, more advanced deep learning techniques, and real-world applications to provide personalized learning recommendations to students based on their predicted performance. This paper contributes to the understanding of game-based learning and provides insights into optimizing educational game experiences for improved student outcomes and skill development.",

            "abstract": "Given a graph with partial observations of node features, how can we estimate the missing features accurately? Feature estimation is a crucial problem for analyzing real-world graphs whose features are commonly missing during the data collection process. Accurate estimation not only provides diverse information of nodes but also supports the inference of graph neural networks that require the full observation of node features. However, designing an effective approach for estimating high-dimensional features is challenging, since it requires an estimator to have large representation power, increasing the risk of overfitting. In this work, we propose SVGA (Structured Variational Graph Autoencoder), an accurate method for feature estimation. SVGA applies strong regularization to the distribution of latent variables by structured variational inference, which models the prior of variables as Gaussian Markov random field based on the graph structure. As a result, SVGA combines the advantages of probabilistic inference and graph neural networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in real datasets.",

            "abstract": "When recommending personalized top-$k$ items to users, how can we recommend the items diversely to them while satisfying their needs? Aggregately diversified recommender systems aim to recommend a variety of items across whole users without sacrificing the recommendation accuracy. They increase the exposure opportunities of various items, which in turn increase potential revenue of sellers as well as user satisfaction. However, it is challenging to tackle aggregate-level diversity with a matrix factorization (MF), one of the most common recommendation model, since skewed real world data lead to skewed recommendation results of MF. In this work, we propose DivMF (Diversely Regularized Matrix Factorization), a novel matrix factorization method for aggregately diversified recommendation. DivMF regularizes a score matrix of an MF model to maximize coverage and entropy of top-$k$ recommendation lists to aggregately diversify the recommendation results. We also propose an unmasking mechanism and carefully designed mi i-batch learning technique for accurate and efficient training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that DivMF achieves the state-of-the-art performance in aggregately diversified recommendation.",

            "abstract": "How can we recommend existing bundles to users accurately? How can we generate new tailored bundles for users? Recommending a bundle, or a group of various items, has attracted widespread attention in e-commerce owing to the increased satisfaction of both users and providers. Bundle matching and bundle generation are two representative tasks in bundle recommendation. The bundle matching task is to correctly match existing bundles to users while the bundle generation is to generate new bundles that users would prefer. Although many recent works have developed bundle recommendation models, they fail to achieve high accuracy since they do not handle heterogeneous data effectively and do not learn a method for customized bundle generation. In this paper, we propose BundleMage, an accurate approach for bundle matching and generation. BundleMage effectively mixes user preferences of items and bundles using an adaptive gate technique to achieve high accuracy for the bundle matching. BundleMage also generates a personalized bundle by learning a generation module that exploits a user preference and the characteristic of a given incomplete bundle to be completed. BundleMage further improves its performance using multi-task learning with partially shared parameters. Through extensive experiments, we show that BundleMage achieves up to 6.6% higher nDCG in bundle matching and 6.3\u00d7 higher nDCG in bundle generation than the best competitors. We also provide qualitative analysis that BundleMage effectively generates bundles considering both the tastes of users and the characteristics of target bundles.",

            "abstract": "How can we accurately recommend actions for users to control their devices at home? Action recommendation for smart home has attracted increasing attention due to its potential impact on the markets of Internet of Things (IoT). However, designing an effective action recommender system is challenging because it requires handling context correlations, considering both queried contexts and previous histories of users, and dealing with capricious intentions in history. In this work, we propose SmartSense, an accurate action recommendation method for smart home. For individual action, SmartSense summarizes its device control and temporal contexts in a self-attentive manner, to reflect the importance of the correlation between them. SmartSense then summarizes sequences considering queried contexts in a query-attentive manner to extract the query-related patterns from the sequential actions. SmartSense also transfers the commonsense knowledge from routine data to better handle intentions in action sequences. As a result, SmartSense addresses all three main challenges of action recommendation for smart home, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance giving up to 9.8% higher mAP@1 than the best competitor.",

            "abstract": "Given multiple source datasets with labels, how can we train a target model with no labeled data? Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) aims to train a model using multiple source datasets different from a target dataset in the absence of target data labels. MSDA is a crucial problem applicable to many practical cases where labels for the target data are unavailable due to privacy issues. Existing MSDA frameworks are limited since they align data without considering conditional distributions p(x|y) of each domain. They also miss a lot of target label information by not considering the target label at all and relying on only one feature extractor. In this paper, we propose Ensemble Multi-source Domain Adaptation with Pseudolabels (EnMDAP), a novel method for multi-source domain adaptation. EnMDAP exploits label-wise moment matching to align conditional distributions p(x|y), using pseudolabels for the unavailable target labels, and introduces ensemble learning theme by using multiple feature extractors for accurate domain adaptation. Extensive experiments show that EnMDAP provides the state-of-the-art performance for multi-source domain adaptation tasks in both of image domains and text domains.",

            "abstract": "Given a sparse rating matrix and an auxiliary matrix of users or items, how can we accurately predict missing ratings considering different data contexts of entities? Many previous studies proved that utilizing the additional information with rating data is helpful to improve the performance. However, existing methods are limited in that 1) they ignore the fact that data contexts of rating and auxiliary matrices are different, 2) they have restricted capability of expressing independence information of users or items, and 3) they assume the relation between a user and an item is linear.We propose DACONA, a neural network based method for recommendation with a rating matrix and an auxiliary matrix. DACONA is designed with the following three main ideas. First, we propose a data context adaptation layer to extract pertinent features for different data contexts. Second, DACONA represents each entity with latent interaction vector and latent independence vector. Unlike previous methods, both of the two vectors are not limited in size. Lastly, while previous matrix factorization based methods predict missing values through the inner-product of latent vectors, DACONA learns a non-linear function of them via a neural network. We show that DACONA is a generalized algorithm including the standard matrix factorization and the collective matrix factorization as special cases. Through comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets, we show that DACONA provides the state-of-the-art accuracy.",

In this work, we propose belief propagation networks (BPN), a novel approach to train a deep neural network in a hard inductive setting, where the test data are given without neighborhood information. BPN uses a differentiable classifier to compute the prior distributions of nodes, and then diffuses the priors through the graphical structure, independently from the prior computation. This separable structure improves the generalization performance of BPN for isolated test instances, compared with previous approaches that jointly use the feature and neighborhood without distinction. As a result, BPN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in four datasets with an average margin of 2.4% points in accuracy.",

Many online services provide social networks among users, and it is crucial to utilize social information since recommendation by a friend is more likely to grab attention than the one from a random user. Also, explaining why items are recommended is very important in encouraging the users' actions such as actual purchases. Exploiting both ratings and social graph for recommendation, however, is not trivial because of the heterogeneity of the data. \nIn this paper, we propose UniWalk, an explainable and accurate recommender system that exploits both social network and rating data. UniWalk combines both data into a unified graph, learns latent features of users and items, and recommends items to each user through the features. Importantly, it explains why items are recommended together with the recommendation results. Extensive experiments show that UniWalk provides the best explainability and achieves the state-of-the-art-accuracy.",

            "abstract": "In order to perform the surveillance and tracking of space objects, optical and radar sensors are the technical components for space situational awareness system. Especially, space situational awareness radar system in combination with optical sensors network plays an outstanding role for space situational awareness. At present, OWL-Net(Optical Wide Field patrol Network) optical system, which is the only infra structures for tracking of space objects in Korea is very limited in all-weather and observation time. Therefore, the development of radar system capable of continuous operation is becoming an essential space situational awareness element. Therefore, for an efficient space situational awareness at the current state, the strategy of the space situational awareness radar development should be considered. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the efficiency of radar system for detection and tracking of space objects. The detection capabilities are limited to an altitude of 2,000 km with debris size of 1 m 2 in radar cross section (RCS) for the radar operating frequencies of L, S, C, X, and Ku-band. The power budget analysis results showed that the maximum detection range of 2,000km can be achieved with the transmitted power of 900 kW, transmit and receive antenna gains of 40 dB and 43 dB, respectively, pulse width of 2 ms, and a signal processing gain of 13.3dB, at frequency of 1.3GHz. The required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was assumed to be 12.6 dB for probability of detection of 80% with false alarm rate 10 -6 . Through the efficiency analysis and trade-off study, the key parameters of the radar system are designed. As a result, this research will provide the guideline for the conceptual design of space situational awareness system",
