            "abstract": "Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent time-resolved relations between entities in many natural and artificial systems. Many techniques were devised to investigate the evolution of temporal graphs by comparing their state at different time points. However, quantifying the similarity between temporal graphs as a whole is an open problem. Here, we use embeddings based on time-respecting random walks to introduce a new notion of distance between temporal graphs. This distance is well-defined for pairs of temporal graphs with different numbers of nodes and different time spans. We study the case of a matched pair of graphs, when a known relation exists between their nodes, and the case of unmatched graphs, when such a relation is unavailable and the graphs may be of different sizes. We use empirical and synthetic temporal network data to show that the distance we introduce discriminates graphs with different topological and temporal properties. We provide an efficient implementation of the distance computation suitable for large-scale temporal graphs.",

            "abstract": "Accurate relative wealth estimates in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICS) are crucial to help policymakers address socio-demographic inequalities under the guidance of the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations. Survey-based approaches have traditionally been employed to collect highly granular data about income, consumption, or household material goods to create index-based poverty estimates. However, these methods are only capture persons in households (i.e., in the household sample framework) and they do not include migrant populations or unhoused citizens. Novel approaches combining frontier data, computer vision, and machine learning have been proposed to complement these existing approaches. However, the strengths and limitations of these big-data-derived indices have yet to be sufficiently studied. In this paper, we focus on the case of Indonesia and examine one frontier-data derived Relative Wealth Index (RWI), created by the Facebook Data for Good initiative, that utilizes connectivity data from the Facebook Platform and satellite imagery data to produce a high-resolution estimate of relative wealth for 135 countries. We examine it concerning asset-based relative wealth indices estimated from existing high-quality national-level traditional survey instruments, the USAID-developed Demographic Health Survey (DHS), and the Indonesian National Socio-economic survey (SUSENAS). In this work, we aim to understand how the frontier-data derived index can be used to inform anti-poverty programs in Indonesia and the Asia Pacific region. First, we unveil key features that affect the comparison between the traditional and non-traditional sources, such as the publishing time and authority and the granularity of the spatial aggregation of the data. Second, to provide operational input, we hypothesize how a re-distribution of resources based on the RWI map would impact a current social program, the Social Protection Card (KPS) of Indonesia and assess impact. In this hypothetical scenario, we estimate the percentage of Indonesians eligible for the program, which would have been incorrectly excluded from a social protection payment had the RWI been used in place of the survey-based wealth index. The exclusion error in that case would be 32.82%. Within the context of the KPS program targeting, we noted significant differences between the RWI map's predictions and the SUSENAS ground truth index estimates.",

            "abstract": "Conflicts cause immense human suffering, violate human rights, and affect people's stability. Colombia is affected for decades by a high level of armed conflicts and violence. The political and socio-economic situation, drug trafficking in the Colombian economy, and natural disasters events affect the country and foster general violence. In this work, we aim to evaluate the role of the socioeconomic, political, financial, and environmental determinants of conflicts in the Colombian context. To achieve these aims, we apply a spatial analysis to explore patterns and identify areas that suffer from high levels of conflict. We investigate the role of determinants and their relationship with conflicts through spatial regression models. In this study, we do not consider only the entire Colombian territory, but we extend the analysis to a restricted area (Norte de Santander department) to explore the phenomena locally. Our findings indicate a possible diffusion process of conflicts and the presence of spillover effects among regions by comparing the two most known spatial regression models. As regards possible key drivers of conflicts, our results show that surprisingly socioeconomic variables present very little relationship with conflicts, while natural disasters and cocaine areas show a relevant impact on them. Despite some variables seeming to be the more informative to explain the process globally, they highlight a strong relationship for only a few specific areas while considering a local analysis. This result proves the importance of moving to a local investigation to strengthen our understanding and bring out additional interesting information. Our work emphasizes how the identification of key drivers of violence is crucial to have evidence to inform subnational governments and to support the decision-making policies that could assess targeted policy options.",

            "title": "Interplay between mobility, multi-seeding and lockdowns shapes COVID-19 local impact",
            "abstract": "Assessing the impact of mobility on epidemic spreading is of crucial importance for understanding the effect of policies like mass quarantines and selective re-openings. While many factors affect disease incidence at a local level, making it more or less homogeneous with respect to other areas, the importance of multi-seeding has often been overlooked. Multi-seeding occurs when several independent (non-clustered) infected individuals arrive at a susceptible population. This can lead to independent outbreaks that spark from distinct areas of the local contact (social) network. Such mechanism has the potential to boost incidence, making control efforts and contact tracing less effective. Here, through a modeling approach we show that the effect produced by the number of initial infections is non-linear on the incidence peak and peak time. When case importations are carried by mobility from an already infected area, this effect is further enhanced by the local demography and underlying mixing patterns: the impact of every seed is larger in smaller populations. Finally, both in the model simulations and the analysis, we show that a multi-seeding effect combined with mobility restrictions can explain the observed spatial heterogeneities in the first wave of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in five European countries. Our results allow us for identifying what we have called epidemic epicenter: an area that shapes incidence and mortality peaks in the entire country. The present work further clarifies the nonlinear effects that mobility can have on the evolution of an epidemic and highlight their relevance for epidemic control.",

            "abstract": "\n Digital contact tracing is increasingly considered as a tool to control infectious disease outbreaks. As part of a broader test, trace, isolate, and quarantine strategy, digital contract tracing apps have been proposed to alleviate lock-downs, and to return societies to a more normal situation in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Early work evaluating digital contact tracing did not consider important features and heterogeneities present in real-world contact patterns which impact epidemic dynamics. Here, we fill this gap by considering a modeling framework informed by empirical high-resolution contact data to analyze the impact of digital contact tracing apps in the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate how well contact tracing apps, coupled with the quarantine of identified contacts, can mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in realistic scenarios such as a university campus, a workplace, or a high school. We find that restrictive policies are more effective in confining the epidemics but come at the cost of quarantining a large part of the population. It is possible to avoid this effect by considering less strict policies, which only consider contacts with longer exposure and at shorter distance to be at risk. Our results also show that isolation and tracing can help keep re-emerging outbreaks under control provided that hygiene and social distancing measures limit the reproductive number to 1.5. Moreover, we confirm that a high level of app adoption is crucial to make digital contact tracing an effective measure. Our results may inform app-based contact tracing efforts currently being implemented across several countries worldwide.",

More specifically, we investigate how well contact tracing apps, coupled with the quarantine of identified contacts, can mitigate a spread in realistic scenarios such as a university campus, a workplace, or a high school. We find that restrictive policies are more effective in confining the epidemics but come at the cost of quarantining a large part of the population with a consequent social cost. It is possible to design less limiting policies, considering at risk only contacts with longer exposure and at shorter distance, in order to avoid this effect. Our results also show that isolation and tracing alone are unlikely to be sufficient to keep an outbreak under control, and additional measures need to be implemented simultaneously. Moreover, we confirm that a high level of app adoption is crucial to make digital contact tracing an effective measure. Finally, given the currently implemented infectiousness, we find that strategies focusing on long exposure times, even for weak links, perform better than approaches that emphasize close-range contacts for shorter time-periods. Our results have implications for the app-based contact tracing efforts currently being implemented across several countries worldwide.",

            "abstract": "The rapid dynamics of COVID-19 calls for quick and effective tracking of virus transmission chains and early detection of outbreaks, especially in the phase 2 of the pandemic, when lockdown and other restriction measures are progressively withdrawn, in order to avoid or minimize contagion resurgence. For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale adoption by many countries. A centralized approach, where data sensed by the app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens' privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens' \"personal data stores\", to be shared separately and selectively, voluntarily, only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy preserving level of granularity. This approach better protects the personal sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: it allows for detailed information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion;and, in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. Our recommendation is two-fold. First to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light touch, in order to manage the collection of location data locally on the device, and allow the user to share spatio-temporal aggregates - if and when they want, for specific aims - with health authorities, for instance. Second, we favour a longer-term pursuit of realizing a Personal Data Store vision, giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective good in the measure they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective efforts for rebuilding society.",

Targeted measures such as case isolation and contact tracing can alleviate the societal cost of lock-downs by containing the spread where and when it occurs. To assess the relative and combined impact of manual contact tracing (MCT) and digital (app-based) contact tracing, we feed a compartmental model for COVID-19 with high-resolution datasets describing contacts between individuals in several contexts. We show that the benefit (epidemic size reduction) is generically linear in the fraction of contacts recalled during MCT and quadratic in the app adoption, with no threshold effect. The cost (number of quarantines) versus benefit curve has a characteristic parabolic shape, independent of the type of tracing, with a potentially high benefit and low cost if app adoption and MCT efficiency are high enough. Benefits are higher and the cost lower if the epidemic reproductive number is lower, showing the importance of combining tracing with additional mitigation measures. The observed phenomenology is qualitatively robust across datasets and parameters. We moreover obtain analytically similar results on simplified models.",
