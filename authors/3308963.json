            "title": "DiffLoad: Uncertainty Quantification in Load Forecasting with Diffusion Model",
            "abstract": "Electrical load forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making for power systems, including unit commitment and economic dispatch. The integration of renewable energy sources and the occurrence of external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have rapidly increased uncertainties in load forecasting. The uncertainties in load forecasting can be divided into two types: epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty. Separating these types of uncertainties can help decision-makers better understand where and to what extent the uncertainty is, thereby enhancing their confidence in the following decision-making. This paper proposes a diffusion-based Seq2Seq structure to estimate epistemic uncertainty and employs the robust additive Cauchy distribution to estimate aleatoric uncertainty. Our method not only ensures the accuracy of load forecasting but also demonstrates the ability to separate the two types of uncertainties and be applicable to different levels of loads.

            "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved impressive performance on various time series tasks. The most prominent advantage of SSL is that it reduces the dependence on labeled data. Based on the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, even a small amount of labeled data can achieve high performance. Compared with many published self-supervised surveys on computer vision and natural language processing, a comprehensive survey for time series SSL is still missing. To fill this gap, we review current state-of-the-art SSL methods for time series data in this article. To this end, we first comprehensively review existing surveys related to SSL and time series, and then provide a new taxonomy of existing time series SSL methods by summarizing them from three perspectives: generative-based, contrastive-based, and adversarial-based. These methods are further divided into ten subcategories with detailed reviews and discussions about their key intuitions, main frameworks, advantages and disadvantages. To facilitate the experiments and validation of time series SSL methods, we also summarize datasets commonly used in time series forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and clustering tasks. Finally, we present the future directions of SSL for time series analysis.",

            "abstract": "Load forecasting techniques have been well developed and almost all typical models are trying to minimize the error over all equally weighted data samples. However, treating all data equally in the training process is unreasonable and even harmful to model generalization. This letter investigates the issue of data inequality which is crucial but is overlooked in the field of load forecasting. To this end, we propose a novel load forecasting method via sample reweighting to tackle the data inequality issue. The proposed method determines the weights of samples using their gradients and influence functions in the process of training. Case studies on a real-world load dataset using linear models, artificial neural networks, and long short term memory in both deterministic and probabilistic situations all reveal that assigning different weights to various samples can improve forecasting accuracy.",

            "title": "SADI: A Self-Adaptive Decomposed Interpretable Framework for Electric Load Forecasting Under Extreme Events",
            "abstract": "Accurate prediction of electric load is crucial in power grid planning and management. In this paper, we solve the electric load forecasting problem under extreme events such as scorching heats. One challenge for accurate forecasting is the lack of training samples under extreme conditions. Also load usually changes dramatically in these extreme conditions, which calls for interpretable model to make better decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel forecasting framework, named Self-adaptive Decomposed Interpretable framework (SaDI), which ensembles long-term trend, short-term trend, and period modelings to capture temporal characteristics in different components. The external variable triggered loss is proposed for the imbalanced learning under extreme events. Furthermore, Generalized Additive Model (GAM) is employed in the framework for desirable interpretability. The experiments on both Central China electric load and public energy meters from buildings show that the proposed SaDI framework achieves average 22.14% improvement compared with the current state-of- the-art algorithms in forecasting under extreme events in terms of daily mean of normalized RMSE.

            "abstract": "Spectral-temporal graph neural network is a promising abstraction underlying most time series forecasting models that are based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, more is needed to know about the underpinnings of this branch of methods. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that unravels the expressive power of spectral-temporal GNNs. Our results show that linear spectral-temporal GNNs are universal under mild assumptions, and their expressive power is bounded by our extended first-order Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on discrete-time dynamic graphs. To make our findings useful in practice on valid instantiations, we discuss related constraints in detail and outline a theoretical blueprint for designing spatial and temporal modules in spectral domains. Building on these insights and to demonstrate how powerful spectral-temporal GNNs are based on our framework, we propose a simple instantiation named Temporal Graph GegenConv (TGC), which significantly outperforms most existing models with only linear components and shows better model efficiency.",

Despite recent developments of forecasting algorithms in the machine learning community, there is a lack of general and advanced algorithms specifically considering requirements from the power industry perspective. In this paper, we present eForecaster, a unified AI platform including robust, flexible, and explainable machine learning algorithms for diversified electricity forecasting applications. Since Oct. 2021, multiple commercial bus load, system load, and renewable energy forecasting systems built upon eForecaster have been deployed in seven provinces of China. The deployed systems consistently reduce the average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 39.8% to 77.0%, with reduced manual work and explainable guidance. In particular, eForecaster also integrates multiple interpretation methods to uncover the working mechanism of the predictive models, which significantly improves forecasts adoption and user satisfaction.",

This shift towards continuous monitoring and recording, fueled by advancements in sensing technologies, necessitates the development of new tools and solutions. Despite extensive study, the importance of time series analysis continues to increase. However, modern time series data present challenges to existing techniques, including irregular sampling and spatiotemporal structures. Time series mining research is both challenging and rewarding as it connects diverse disciplines and requires interdisciplinary solutions. The goals of this workshop are to (1) highlight the significant challenges that underpin learning and mining from time series data (e.g., irregular sampling, spatiotemporal structure, uncertainty quantification), (2) discuss recent algorithmic, theoretical, statistical, or systems-based developments for tackling these problems, and (3) to synergize the research activities and discuss both new and open problems in time series analysis and mining. In summary, our workshop will focus on both the theoretical and practical aspects of time series data analysis and will provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss potential research directions and critical technical issues and present solutions to tackle related issues in practical applications. We will invite researchers and practitioners from the related areas of AI, machine learning, data science, statistics, and many others to contribute to this workshop.",

            "abstract": "Continuous-time event sequences play a vital role in real-world domains such as healthcare, finance, online shopping, social networks, and so on. To model such data, temporal point processes (TPPs) have emerged as the most natural and competitive models, making a significant impact in both academic and application communities. Despite the emergence of many powerful models in recent years, there hasn't been a central benchmark for these models and future research endeavors. This lack of standardization impedes researchers and practitioners from comparing methods and reproducing results, potentially slowing down progress in this field. In this paper, we present EasyTPP, the first central repository of research assets (e.g., data, models, evaluation programs, documentations) in the area of event sequence modeling. Our EasyTPP makes several unique contributions to this area: a unified interface of using existing datasets and adding new datasets; a wide range of evaluation programs that are easy to use and extend as well as facilitate reproducible research; implementations of popular neural TPPs, together with a rich library of modules by composing which one could quickly build complex models. All the data and implementation can be found at https://github.com/ant-research/EasyTemporalPointProcess. We will actively maintain this benchmark and welcome contributions from other researchers and practitioners. Our benchmark will help promote reproducible research in this field, thus accelerating research progress as well as making more significant real-world impacts.",

            "abstract": "Periodicity detection is an important task in time series analysis, but still a challenging problem due to the diverse characteristics of time series data like abrupt trend change, outlier, noise, and especially block missing data. In this paper, we propose a robust and effective periodicity detection algorithm for time series with block missing data. We first design a robust trend filter to remove the interference of complicated trend patterns under missing data. Then, we propose a robust autocorrelation function (ACF) that can handle missing values and outliers effectively. We rigorously prove that the proposed robust ACF can still work well when the length of the missing block is less than 1/3 of the period length. Last, by combining the time-frequency information, our algorithm can generate the period length accurately. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing periodicity detection algorithms on real-world time series datasets.",

            "abstract": "Anomalies are ubiquitous in real-world time-series data which call for effective and timely detection, especially in an unsupervised setting for labeling cost saving. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised density reconstruction model for multi-dimensional time-series anomaly detection. In particular, it directly handles an important realistic setting that the detection is achieved towards raw time-series contaminated with noise for training, in contrast to most existing anomaly detection works that assume the training data is in general clean i.e., not contaminated with anomaly. It extends recent advancements in deep generative models and state space models to achieve robust anomaly detection. Our approach comprises of a novel state space based generative model, a filtering based inference model, together with a carefully-designated emission model based on robust statistics theory. Extensive experimental results are conducted to show that our approach can adapt to complex patterns even given severely contaminated training data. We also develop visualization techniques to help better understand the behavior of the anomaly detection models. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",
