            "abstract": "In this article, we describe a general methodology for enhancing sensing accuracy in cyber-physical systems that involve structured human interactions in noisy physical environment. We define structured human interactions as domain-specific workflow. A novel workflow-aware sensing model is proposed to jointly correct unreliable sensor data and keep track of states in a workflow. We also propose a new inference algorithm to handle cases with partially known states and objects as supervision. Our model is evaluated with extensive simulations. As a concrete application, we develop a novel log service called Emergency Transcriber, which can automatically document operational procedures followed by teams of first responders in emergency response scenarios. Evaluation shows that our system has significant improvement over commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors and keeps track of workflow states with high accuracy in noisy physical environment.",

            "abstract": "Using wireless networks in medical Cyber-Physical Systems could be challenging. Because the medical system not only assists the medical personnel to deliver medical services to the patient but also needs to deal with accidental situations such as communication failures without compromising the patient's safety. Previous research work tackled the communication failure problems in medical CPS from architecture perspectives. However, as medical devices configurations become more complex when a medical CPS is composed of many medical devices, we need to know that whether the certain configuration and a combination of the devices will not compromise the patient's safety. We present an algorithm to tackle the problem that whether a given system configuration exists a possible series of system transitions that allows the physicians to perform medical operations; in the mean time, the system transitions ensure the patient's safety while communication failures may happen during the transitions.",

            "abstract": "In a medical environment such as Intensive Care Unit, there are many possible reasons to cause errors, and one important reason is the effect of human intellectual tasks. In this paper, we first provide five categories of generic intellectual tasks of humans, where tasks among each category may lead to potential medical errors. Then, we present an integrated modeling framework to model a medical Cyber-Physical-Human System (CPHSystem) and use UPPAAL as the foundation to integrate and verify the whole medical CPHSystem design models. When designing a medical CPHSystem, developers need to consider whether the system design can mitigate the errors caused by these tasks or not. With a verified and comprehensive model, we can design a more accurate and acceptable system. We use a cardiac arrest resuscitation guidance and navigation system (CAR-GNSystem) as the motivation example for such medical CPHSystem modeling. Experimental results show that the CPHSystem models help determine system design flaws and can mitigate the potential medical errors caused by the human intellectual tasks.",

            "abstract": "Improving effectiveness and safety of patient care is an ultimate objective for medical cyber- physical systems. However, the existing medical best practice guidelines in hospital handbooks are often lengthy and difficult for medical staff to remember and apply clinically. Statechart is a widely used model in designing complex systems and enables rapid prototyping and clinical validation with medical doctors. However, clinical validation is often not adequate for guaranteeing the correctness and safety of medical cyber-physical systems, and formal verification is required. The paper presents an approach that transforms medical best practice guidelines to verifiable statechart models and supports both clinical validation in collaboration with medical doctors and formal verification. In particular, we use an open source statechart tool Yakindu to model best practice guidelines and use the statechart to interact with doctors for validating the model correctness. The statechart model is then automatically transformed to a verifiable formal model, such as timed automata, so that existing formal verification tool, such as UPPAAL, can be used to verify required safety properties. The approach also provides the ability to trace back to the paths in the statechart model (Yakindu model) when a specific property in its associated formal model (UPPAAL model) fails. A cardiac arrest scenario is used as a case study to validate the proposed approach. The tool is available on our website www.cs.iit.edu/~code/software/Y2U.",

Most current medical monitoring systems provide little contextual information on patient state. We present best practice assist system to help medical staff assess patient state more accurately and adapt her care plan according to the best practice guidelines and community consensus. The main components of our system are 1) an efficient and clinically sound representation of patient state in the form of disease and interacting organ states 2) a best practice manager that encodes the best practice monitoring and treatment guidelines for a given patient condition. Both components are modeled using finite state machine formalism. In addition, we have implemented a patient control panel and a graphical display to simulate clinical scenarios. Using a cardiac arrest scenario, we demonstrate how our system can help medical staff with patient assessment and adherence to best practice.",

            "abstract": "Software is everywhere. The increasing requirement of supporting a wide variety of domains has rapidly increased the complexity of software systems, making them hard to maintain and the training process harder for end-users, which in turn ultimately demanded the development of user-friendly application software with simple interfaces that makes them easy, especially for non-professional personnel, to employ, and interact with. However, due to the lack of source code access for third-party software and the lack of non-graphical interfaces such as web-services or RMI (Remote Method Invocation) access to application functionality, synchronization between heterogeneous closed-box software interfaces and a user-friendly version of those interfaces has become a major challenge. In this paper, we design SINk1, a middleware that enables synchronization of multiple heterogeneous software applications, using only graphical interface, without the need for source code access or access to the entire platform's control. SINk helps with synchronization of closed-box industry software, where in fact the only possible way of communication is through software interfaces. It leverages efficient client sever architecture, socket based protocol, adaptation to resolution changes, and parameter mapping mechanisms to transfer control events to ensure the real-time requirements of synchronization among multiple interfaces are met. Our proof-of-concept evaluation shows there is in fact potential usage of our middleware in a wide variety of domains.",

The intellectual contribution lies in an algorithm for joint estimation of the current state of the workflow together with correction of noisy sensor measurements, given only the noisy measurements and an overall workflow description. We demonstrate through simulations and a physical implementation the degree to which knowledge of workflow can increase sensing accuracy.

            "abstract": "In medical cyber-physical environments, synchronizing supervisory medical systems, physicians' behavior and patient conditions in compliance with best practice workflow is essential for patient safety. However, patient conditions change rapidly and asynchronously, so workflows have to be adapted to the changes safely. In this paper, we propose a workflow adaptation and validation protocol to help physicians safely adapt workflows to react to patient adverse events based on the path physiological models. Unlike conventional validation protocols, the medical cyber-physical systems cannot lock or recover the states of physical components, such as patient conditions. Therefore, the proposed protocol dynamically adapts the workflow to the patient conditions while validating safety requirements in collaboration with physicians. Moreover, we use cardiac arrest resuscitation as a case study to verify the safety and correctness properties of the proposed protocol.",

            "abstract": "In cyber-physical-human medical environments, coordinating supervisory medical systems and medical staff to perform treatments in in accordance with best practice is essential for patient safety. However, the dynamics of patient conditions and the non-deterministic nature of potential side effects of treatments pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a validation protocol to enforce the correct execution sequence of performing treatment, regarding preconditions validation, side effects monitoring, and expected responses checking based on the path physiological models. The proposed protocol organizes the medical information concisely and comprehensively to help medical staff validate treatments. Unlike traditional validation mechanism for cyber systems, the medical system cannot lock or rollback the states of physical components, such as patient conditions. Therefore, the proposed protocol dynamically adapts to the patient conditions and side effects of treatments. Moreover, a cardiac arrest scenario is used as a case study to verify the safety and correctness properties of the proposed protocol.",

However, statistics indicates that preventable medical error rate is highest in ICU as compared to other hospital units. Many preventable medical errors are result from unintended deviation from the best practice guidelines, because medical staff are under tremendous pressure and overloaded by great amount of unorganized information. In order to reduce preventable medical errors, we develop a coordination protocol to validate treatments based on the pathophysiological models1.",
