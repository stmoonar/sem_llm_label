            "title": "Applying the FAIR Principles to Computational Workflows",
            "abstract": "Recent trends within computational and data sciences show an increasing recognition and adoption of computational workflows as tools for productivity, reproducibility, and democratized access to platforms and processing know-how. As digital objects to be shared, discovered, and reused, computational workflows benefit from the FAIR principles, which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Workflows Community Initiative's FAIR Workflows Working Group (WCI-FW), a global and open community of researchers and developers working with computational workflows across disciplines and domains, has systematically addressed the application of both FAIR data and software principles to computational workflows. We present our recommendations with commentary that reflects our discussions and justifies our choices and adaptations. Like the software and data principles on which they are based, these are offered to workflow users and authors, workflow management system developers, and providers of workflow services as guide rails for adoption and fodder for discussion. Workflows are becoming more prevalent as documented, automated instruments for data analysis, data collection, AI-based predictions, and simulations. The FAIR recommendations for workflows that we propose in this paper will maximize their value as research assets and facilitate their adoption by the wider community.",

            "abstract": "The Energy Efficient High Performance Computing Working Group (EE HPC WG) has assembled a small diverse team to write a short investigative report on electrical commissioning. The purpose of the investigative report is to evaluate the need for electrical commissioning guidelines specific to High Performance Computing (HPC) data centers given their unique IT equipment load densities and power profiles. It is the consensus of the team that special electrical commissioning guidelines are needed and the EE HPC WG will author the initial guidelines. The scope of the guidelines will include the static and dynamic electrical aspects of commissioning practices that are specific to high performance computing and more importantly, cover the transient aspects of electrical commissioning. The fluctuating nature of many compute nodes can dramatically influence generation, transmission, and distribution of electrical power. HPC data center lessons learned and best practices will be examined and used to enhance the electrical commissioning guidelines. The primary audience for the guidelines is facility engineers and operators of HPC data centers. The guidelines will also be applicable to others that support HPC data centers, ranging from utilities and their electrical grid infrastructure to IT equipment manufacturers whose machines are being commissioned at the end of the process.",
