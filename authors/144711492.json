            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "We design a system, SolarGest, which can recognize hand gestures near a solar-powered device by analyzing the patterns of the photocurrent. SolarGest is based on the observation that each gesture interferes with incident light rays on the solar panel in a unique way, leaving its discernible signature in harvested photocurrent. Using solar energy harvesting laws, we develop a model to optimize design and usage of SolarGest. To further improve the robustness of SolarGest under non-deterministic operating conditions, we combine dynamic time warping with Z-score transformation in a signal processing pipeline to pre-process each gesture waveform before it is analyzed for classification. We evaluate SolarGest with both conventional opaque solar cells as well as emerging see-through transparent cells. Our experiments demonstrate that SolarGest achieves 99% for six gestures with a single cell and 95% for fifteen gesture with a <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2\\times 2$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>\u00d7</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"lan-ieq1-3148143.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> solar cell array.

            "abstract": "Earables have been gaining popularity over the past few years for their ease of use and convenience over wired earphones. However, modern-day earables usually have a limited interface, inhibiting their potential as an accessible medium of input. To this end, we present EarBender: an ear-based real-time system that bridges the gap between earables and on-body interaction, providing a more diverse and natural form of interaction with devices. EarBender enables touch-based hand-to-ear gestures on mobile devices by leveraging inertial sensors in commercially available earable devices. Our proposed system detects the slight deformation in a user\u2019s ear resulting from different ear-based actions including swiping and tapping and classifies the action performed. EarBender is designed to be energy-efficient, easy to deploy and robust to different users, requiring little to no calibration. We implement a prototype of EarBender using eSense, a multi-sensory earable platform, and evaluate it in different scenarios and parameter settings. Results show that the system can detect the occurrence of gestures with a 96.8% accuracy and classify seven different hand-to-ear gestures with an accuracy up to 97.4% maintained across four subjects.",

            "abstract": "Due to the noisy indoor radio propagation channel, radio frequency (RF)-based location determination systems usually require a tedious calibration phase to construct an RF fingerprint of the area of interest. This fingerprint varies with the used mobile device, changes of the transmit power of smart access points (APs), and dynamic changes in the environment; requiring re-calibration of the area of interest; which reduces the technology ease of use. In this paper, we present <italic>IncVoronoi</italic>: a novel system that can provide low-overhead accurate RF-based indoor localization that works in realistic environments. The basic idea is that the relative relation between the received signal strength from two APs at a certain location reflects the relative distance from this location to the respective APs. Building on this, <italic>IncVoronoi</italic> incrementally reduces the user ambiguity region based on refining the Voronoi tessellation of the area of interest. <italic>IncVoronoi</italic> also includes a number of modules to efficiently run in realtime as well as to handle practical deployment issues including the noisy wireless environment, obstacles in the environment, heterogeneous devices hardware, and smart APs. We analyze the complexity of <italic>IncVoronoi</italic> and further deploy it on different Android phones using the iBeacons and WiFi technologies in a university campus and a commercial building. Evaluation of <italic>IncVoronoi</italic> with a side-by-side comparison with traditional fingerprinting techniques shows that it can achieve a consistent median accuracy less than 1.9m under different scenarios with a low beacon density of one beacon every 22m<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^2$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:msup><mml:mrow/><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"elbakly-ieq1-3034620.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Compared to fingerprinting techniques, whose accuracy degrades by at least 156 percent, this accuracy comes with no training overhead and is robust to the different user devices, different transmit powers, and over temporal changes in the environment. This highlights the promise of <italic>IncVoronoi</italic> as a next generation indoor localization system.",

            "abstract": "Quantum computing provides a new way for approaching problem solving, enabling efficient solutions for problems that are hard on classical computers. With researchers around the world showing quantum supremacy and the availability of cloud-based quantum computers, quantum computing is becoming a reality. In this paper, we explore the different directions of the use of quantum computing for location tracking and spatial systems. Specifically, we show an example for the expected gain of using quantum computing for localization by providing an efficient quantum algorithm for RF fingerprinting localization. The proposed quantum algorithm has a complexity that is exponentially better than its classical algorithm version, both in space and running time. We further discuss both software and hardware research challenges and opportunities that researchers can build on to explore this exciting new domain.",

            "title": "Channel Estimation Approach for RIS Assisted MIMO Systems",
            "abstract": "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are planner surfaces that include a large number of passively radiating elements. By changing the phase shifts of these passive elements, RISs can shape the propagation environment. This requires accurate channel state information. However, the Channel Estimation (CE) process is challenging because transmitting and/or signal processing means being unworkable at the RIS. This paper investigates the CE problem for an Uplink (UL) channel for a RIS-aided Multi-user Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) system. In particular, we propose an algorithm to estimate the composite channel, the separate RIS-based channels, and the direct channel for the RIS-assisted system by exploiting symmetric positive definite (SPD) properties matrices; e.g., invertibility and existence of global minimum, and the uniqueness of the Chelosky decomposition. We divide the entire RIS surface into small sub-RISs, and by controlling the changes in these phase shifts for every sub-RIS surfaces, we can estimate the overall channel. Moreover, we propose a simple passive pilot sequence scheduling scheme and jointly adjusting the phase shift coefficients of elements on each sub-RIS unit. Simulation results justify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach algorithm.",

In this article, we study the Quality-of-Position (QoP) assessment problem, which aims to assess in an offline manner the localization accuracy that can be obtained by a user that aims to localize using a FM. Particularly, our proposed ACCES framework uses a generic interpolation method using Gaussian Processes (GP), upon which a navigability score at any location is derived using the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). We derive adaptations of ACCES for both Magnetic and Wi-Fi data and implement a complete visual assessment environment, which has been incorporated in the Anyplace open-source IIN. Our experimental evaluation of ACCES in Anyplace suggests the high qualitative and quantitative benefits of our propositions.",

            "title": "Ubiquitous Transportation Mode Detection Using Single Cell Tower Information",
            "abstract": "Detecting the transportation mode of a user has an overwhelming significance for a vast domain of applications. It has been addressed by several systems using ubiquitous mobile phones. These systems leverage multiple cell towers\u2019 information, GPS, and inertial sensors. However, these phone sensors are limited to a small subset of phones (e.g. high-end phones or phones that support neighboring cell towers information), have high energy consumption, cannot work in certain areas (e.g. inside tunnels for GPS), and/or work only from the user side. Furthermore, there are variations in the receiving capabilities of different cell phone devices according to their brand, quality of receiver and cost which raises the problem of device heterogeneity. In this paper, a transportation mode detection system, MonoSense, is presented that leverages the phone serving cell information only. The basic idea is that the phone speed can be correlated with features extracted directly from both the serving cell tower ID and the received signal strength (RSS) from it. To achieve high detection accuracy with this limited information MonoSense leverages diversity along multiple feature dimensions to synthesize novel features. Specifically, MonoSense exploits both the time and frequency information available from the serving cell tower over different sliding window sizes. Besides, it is shown that both the logarithmic and linear RSS scales provide useful information about the movement of a phone, further enriching the feature space and leading to higher accuracy. Moreover, to overcome the heterogeneity problem, a set of device-independent features is derived and added to the feature set. MonoSense has been evaluated using 500 hours of cellular traces covering 1500 km for more than sixteen months and collected by four users using different android phones. MonoSense achieved an average precision, recall and F-measure of 87.3%, 85.9%, and 86.4%, respectively, in discriminating between stationary, walking and driving modes using only the serving cell tower information, highlighting its ability to enable a wide set of intelligent transportation applications.",

Our system leverages commercial off-the-shelf earables to provide accurate training-free head orientation tracking that is robust in different room settings. We implement a prototype using Android phones and eSense, a commercially available multi-sensory personal earable device. Our evaluation shows that Look&Lock can correctly identify devices inside a user's field of view with accuracy up to 100% and is robust to different configurations and room settings.",

            "abstract": "Accessibility maps are key to support individuals with disabilities to actively participate in the society. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines minimum requirements for roads and other public accommodation spaces to be accessible. Yet, it is sufficient to have one accessible route in a place, and available digital-maps lack accessibility information to help finding that accessible route.In this paper, we present the AccessMap system to automatically extend road-maps with accessibility semantics. It enables indoor and outdoor spaces to be automatically marked as visually-impaired and/or wheel-chaired accessible/inaccessible. AccessMap passively crowdsources measurements from sensors available in the users' smartphones to detect accessibility semantics. It employs a probabilistic framework to build and update the map with the semantics. Evaluation of AccessMap in different countries shows that it can passively detect a wide-range of accessibility semantics with high precision and recall (on average around 89.8% and 86.3% respectively). Furthermore, its probabilistic crowdsourcing framework increases the generated map\u2019s average precision and recall to 98.7% and 99% with as few as seven encounters per semantic.",
