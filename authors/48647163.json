            "abstract": "Much of sensory neuroscience focuses on presenting stimuli that are chosen by the experimenter because they are parametric and easy to sample and are thought to be behaviorally relevant to the organism. However, it is not generally known what these relevant features are in complex, natural scenes. This work focuses on using the retinal encoding of natural movies to determine the presumably behaviorally-relevant features that the brain represents. It is prohibitive to parameterize a natural movie and its respective retinal encoding fully. We use time within a natural movie as a proxy for the whole suite of features evolving across the scene. We then use a task-agnostic deep architecture, an encoder-decoder, to model the retinal encoding process and characterize its representation of \u201ctime in the natural scene\u201d in a compressed latent space. In our end-to-end training, an encoder learns a compressed latent representation from a large population of salamander retinal ganglion cells responding to natural movies, while a decoder samples from this compressed latent space to generate the appropriate future movie frame. By comparing latent representations of retinal activity from three movies, we find that the retina has a generalizable encoding for time in the natural scene: the precise, low-dimensional representation of time learned from one movie can be used to represent time in a different movie, with up to 17 ms resolution. We then show that static textures and velocity features of a natural movie are synergistic. The retina simultaneously encodes both to establishes a generalizable, low-dimensional representation of time in the natural scene.",

            "abstract": "We propose that correlations among neurons are generically strong enough to organize neural activity patterns into a discrete set of clusters, which can each be viewed as a population codeword. Our reasoning starts with the analysis of retinal ganglion cell data using maximum entropy models, showing that the population is robustly in a frustrated, marginally sub-critical, or glassy, state. This leads to an argument that neural populations in many other brain areas might share this structure. Next, we use latent variable models to show that this glassy state possesses well-defined clusters of neural activity. Clusters have three appealing properties: (i) clusters exhibit error correction, i.e., they are reproducibly elicited by the same stimulus despite variability at the level of constituent neurons; (ii) clusters encode qualitatively different visual features than their constituent neurons; and (iii) clusters can be learned by downstream neural circuits in an unsupervised fashion. We hypothesize that these properties give rise to a \u201clearnable\u201d neural code which the cortical hierarchy uses to extract increasingly complex features without supervision or reinforcement.",

            "abstract": "Within a given brain region, individual neurons exhibit a wide variety of different feature selectivities. Here, we investigated the impact of this extensive functional diversity on the population neural code. Our approach was to build optimal decoders to discriminate among stimuli using the spiking output of a real, measured neural population and compare its performance against a matched, homogeneous neural population with the same number of cells and spikes. Analyzing large populations of retinal ganglion cells, we found that the real, heterogeneous population can yield a discrimination error lower than the homogeneous population by several orders of magnitude and consequently can encode much more visual information. This effect increases with population size and with graded degrees of heterogeneity. We complemented these results with an analysis of coding based on the Chernoff distance, as well as derivations of inequalities on coding in certain limits, from which we can conclude that the beneficial effect of heterogeneity occurs over a broad set of conditions. Together, our results indicate that the presence of functional diversity in neural populations can enhance their coding fidelity appreciably. A noteworthy outcome of our study is that this effect can be extremely strong and should be taken into account when investigating design principles for neural circuits.",

Here, we show that a simple, biologically plausible circuit can learn and then readout in real-time the identity of experimentally measured clusters of retinal ganglion cell population activity. After learning, individual readout neurons develop cluster tuning, meaning that they respond strongly to any neural activity pattern in one cluster and weakly to all other inputs. Different readout neurons specialize for different clusters, and all input clusters can be learned, as long as the number of readout units is mildly larger than the number of input clusters. We argue that this operation can be repeated as signals flow up the cortical hierarchy.",

We investigate this phenomenon in recordings of \u223c150 retinal ganglion cells, the retina\u2019s output. We develop a novel statistical model that decomposes the population response into modes; it predicts the distribution of spiking activity in the ganglion cell population with high accuracy. We found that the modes represent localized features of the visual stimulus that are distinct from the features represented by single neurons. Modes form clusters of activity states that are readily discriminated from one another. When we repeated the same visual stimulus, we found that the same mode was robustly elicited. These results suggest that retinal ganglion cells\u2019 collective signaling is endowed with a form of error-correcting code\u2013a principle that may hold in brain areas beyond retina.",

            "abstract": "An appealing new principle for neural population codes is that correlations among neurons organize neural activity patterns into a discrete set of clusters, which can each be viewed as a noise-robust population codeword. Previous studies assumed that these codewords corresponded geometrically with local peaks in the probability landscape of neural population responses. Here, we analyze multiple data sets of the responses of approximately 150 retinal ganglion cells and show that local probability peaks are absent under broad, nonrepeated stimulus ensembles, which are characteristic of natural behavior. However, we find that neural activity still forms noise-robust clusters in this regime, albeit clusters with a different geometry. We start by defining a soft local maximum, which is a local probability maximum when constrained to a fixed spike count. Next, we show that soft local maxima are robustly present and can, moreover, be linked across different spike count levels in the probability landscape to form a ridge. We found that these ridges comprise combinations of spiking and silence in the neural population such that all of the spiking neurons are members of the same neuronal community, a notion from network theory. We argue that a neuronal community shares many of the properties of Donald Hebb's classic cell assembly and show that a simple, biologically plausible decoding algorithm can recognize the presence of a specific neuronal community.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in experimental techniques have allowed the simultaneous recordings of populations of hundreds of neurons, fostering a debate about the nature of the collective structure of population neural activity. Much of this debate has focused on the empirical findings of a phase transition in the parameter space of maximum entropy models describing the measured neural probability distributions, interpreting this phase transition to indicate a critical tuning of the neural code. Here, we instead focus on the possibility that this is a first-order phase transition which provides evidence that the real neural population is in a \u2018structured\u2019, collective state. We show that this collective state is robust to changes in stimulus ensemble and adaptive state. We find that the pattern of pairwise correlations between neurons has a strength that is well within the strongly correlated regime and does not require fine tuning, suggesting that this state is generic for populations of 100+ neurons. We find a clear correspondence between the emergence of a phase transition, and the emergence of attractor-like structure in the inferred energy landscape. A collective state in the neural population, in which neural activity patterns naturally form clusters, provides a consistent interpretation for our results.",

            "title": "Noise-robust modes of the retinal population code geometrically correspond with \"ridges\"",
            "abstract": "Throughout the brain, local circuits encode information using large populations of neurons, yet the structure of this population code remains poorly understood. Previous studies applying the maximum entropy principle to retinal multi-electrode array data have shown that the joint probability distribution over all retinal ganglion cell population states is proliferated by local maxima, which represents a form of clustering of visual stimuli into a discrete set of categories. However, these studies focused on responses to highly repeated stimuli. Another recent study using a hidden Markov model approach likewise found that ganglion cell population activity partitioned into noise-robust clusters, and further that this clustering was present for the non-repeated stimulus regime. Here, we investigate the relationship between the clusters found using these two different modeling approaches. We first demonstrate that local maxima in the probability landscape result from the repeat structure of the stimulus ensemble, and are absent in the more realistic, non-repeated stimulus regime. Nonetheless, we show that structure is still present in the non-repeated stimulus regime in the form of what we call \" soft local maxima, \" which are local maxima within the subspace of all neural activity states that are restricted to have the same spike count. Using a numerical approach, we show that soft local maxima are organized into a reliable sequence across the different spike count levels, which altogether has the geometry of a \" ridge. \" These ridges closely corresponded with the clusters formulated by the hidden Markov model, and moreover with neuron \" communities, \" in the sense defined in computer science. These findings suggest a unified description of the ganglion cell population code across different stimulus repeat statistics, and suggest that ridges or communities may be an important feature of the output population activity extracted by visual processing areas downstream of the retina. While the manner in which information is represented in the brain has been intensively studied at the single neuron level [1\u20133], ample experimental evidence and theoretical consideration have made it evident that neural circuits generally encode and transmit information using large populations of neurons [4\u201317]. With the advent of new experimental technologies, it is becoming increasingly tractable to record from large neuron populations [18\u201321], facilitating questions about the empirical nature of neural population coding that were previously unad-dressable. Fundamental to most conceptual approaches toward answering these questions is, as with the single neuron case, characterizing the probability distribution over \u2026",

            "abstract": "Motion tracking is a challenge the visual system has to solve by reading out the retinal population. It is still unclear how the information from different neurons can be combined together to estimate the position of an object. Here we recorded a large population of ganglion cells in a dense patch of salamander and guinea pig retinas while displaying a bar moving diffusively. We show that the bar\u2019s position can be reconstructed from retinal activity with a precision in the hyperacuity regime using a linear decoder acting on 100+ cells. We then took advantage of this unprecedented precision to explore the spatial structure of the retina\u2019s population code. The classical view would have suggested that the firing rates of the cells form a moving hill of activity tracking the bar\u2019s position. Instead, we found that most ganglion cells in the salamander fired sparsely and idiosyncratically, so that their neural image did not track the bar. Furthermore, ganglion cell activity spanned an area much larger than predicted by their receptive fields, with cells coding for motion far in their surround. As a result, population redundancy was high, and we could find multiple, disjoint subsets of neurons that encoded the trajectory with high precision. This organization allows for diverse collections of ganglion cells to represent high-accuracy motion information in a form easily read out by downstream neural circuits.",
