            "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease with a high and irreversible incidence. In recent years, because brain signals have complex nonlinear dynamics, there has been growing interest in studying complex changes in the time series of brain signals in patients with AD. We reviewed studies of complexity analyses of single-channel time series from electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalogram (MEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in AD and determined future research directions. A systematic literature search for 2000\u20132019 was performed in the Web of Science and PubMed databases, resulting in 126 identified studies. Compared to healthy individuals, the signals from AD patients have less complexity and more predictable oscillations, which are found mainly in the left parietal, occipital, right frontal, and temporal regions. This complexity is considered a potential biomarker for accurately responding to the functional lesion in AD. The current review helps to reveal the patterns of dysfunction in the brains of patients with AD and to investigate whether signal complexity can be used as a biomarker to accurately respond to the functional lesion in AD. We proposed further studies in the signal complexities of AD patients, including investigating the reliability of complexity algorithms and the spatial patterns of signal complexity. In conclusion, the current review helps to better understand the complexity of abnormalities in the AD brain and provide useful information for AD diagnosis.",

            "abstract": "Goal: Idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) represents generalized spike-wave discharges (GSWD) and distributed changes in thalamocortical circuit. The purpose of this study is to investigate how the ongoing alpha oscillation acts upon the local temporal dynamics and spatial hyperconnectivity in epilepsy. Methods: We evaluated the spatiotemporal regulation of alpha oscillations in epileptic state based on simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings in 45 IGE patients. The alpha-BOLD temporal consistency, as well as the effect of alpha power windows on dynamic functional connectivity strength (dFCS) was analyzed. Then, stable synchronization networks during GSWD were constructed, and the spatial covariation with alpha-based network integration was investigated. Results: Increased temporal covariation was demonstrated between alpha power and BOLD fluctuations in thalamus and distributed cortical regions in IGE. High alpha power had inhibition effect on dFCS in healthy controls, while in epilepsy, high alpha windows arose along with the enhancement of dFCS in thalamus, caudate and some default mode network (DMN) regions. Moreover, synchronization networks in GSWD-before, GSWD-onset and GSWD-after stages were constructed, and the connectivity strength in prominent hub nodes (precuneus, thalamus) was associated with the spatially disturbed alpha-based network integration. Conclusion: The results indicated spatiotemporal regulation of alpha in epilepsy by means of the increased power and decreased coherence communication. It provided links between alpha rhythm and the altered temporal dynamics, as well as the hyperconnectivity in thalamus-default mode circuit. Significance: The combination between neural oscillations and epileptic representations may be of clinical importance in terms of seizure prediction and non-invasive interventions.",

            "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies suggest disrupted connections of the brain white matter (WM) network in bipolar disorder (BD). A group of highly interconnected high-density structures, termed the \u2018rich club,\u2019 represents an important network for brain functioning. Recent works have revealed abnormal rich club organization in brain networks in BD. However, little is known regarding changes in the rich club organization of the hemispheric WM network in BD. Forty-nine BD patients and fifty-five age- and sex-matched normal controls (NCs) underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Graph theory approaches were applied to quantify group-specific rich club organization and nodal degree of hemispheric WM networks. We demonstrated that rich club organization of hemispheric WM networks in BD was disrupted, with disrupted feeder and local connections among hub and peripheral regions located in the default mode network (DMN) and the control execution network (CEN). In addition, BD patients showed abnormal asymmetry in the feeder and local connections, involving the hub and peripheral regions associated with emotion regulation and visuospatial functions. Moreover, the clinical symptoms of BD showed a significant correlation with the aberrant asymmetry in the regional degree of peripheral regions. These findings reveal that BD is closely associated with disrupted feeder and local connections but no alteration in rich-club connections in the rich club organization of hemispheric WM networks and provide novel insight into the changes of brain functions in BD.",

            "abstract": "Thalamus interacts with cortical areas, generating oscillations characterized by their rhythm and levels of synchrony. However, little is known of what function the rhythmic dynamic may serve in thalamocortical couplings. This work introduced a general approach to investigate the modulatory contribution of rhythmic scalp network to the thalamo-frontal couplings in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). Here, time-varying rhythmic network was constructed using the adapted directed transfer function between EEG electrodes, and then was applied as a modulator in fMRI-based thalamocortical functional couplings. Furthermore, the relationship between corticocortical connectivity and rhythm-dependent thalamocortical coupling was examined. The results revealed thalamocortical couplings modulated by EEG scalp network have frequency-dependent characteristics. Increased thalamus- sensorimotor network (SMN) and thalamus-default mode network (DMN) couplings in JME were strongly modulated by alpha band. These thalamus-SMN couplings demonstrated enhanced association with SMN-related corticocortical connectivity. In addition, altered theta-dependent and beta-dependent thalamus-frontoparietal network (FPN) couplings were found in FLE. The reduced theta-dependent thalamus-FPN couplings were associated with the decreased FPN-related corticocortical connectivity. This study proposed interactive links between the rhythmic modulation and thalamocortical coupling. The crucial role of SMN and FPN in subcortical-cortical circuit may have implications for intervention in generalized and focal epilepsy.",
