            "abstract": "A healthy and safe indoor environment is an important part of containing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, this work presents a real-time Internet of things (IoT) software architecture to automatically calculate and visualize a COVID-19 aerosol transmission risk estimation. This risk estimation is based on indoor climate sensor data, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature, which is fed into Streaming MASSIF, a semantic stream processing platform, to perform the computations. The results are visualized on a dynamic dashboard that automatically suggests appropriate visualizations based on the semantics of the data. To evaluate the complete architecture, the indoor climate during the student examination periods of January 2020 (pre-COVID) and January 2021 (mid-COVID) was analyzed. When compared to each other, we observe that the COVID-19 measures in 2021 resulted in a safer indoor environment.",

            "abstract": "The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) presents both challenges and opportunities for the power grid, especially for distribution system operators (DSOs). The demand represented by EVs can be significant, but on the other hand, sojourn times of EVs could be longer than the time required to charge their batteries to the desired level (e.g., to cover the next trip). The latter observation means that the electrical load from EVs is characterized by a certain level of flexibility, which could be exploited for example in demand response (DR) approaches (e.g., to balance generation from renewable energy sources). This paper analyzes two data sets, one from a charging-at-home field trial in Flanders (about 8.5k charging sessions) and another from a large-scale EV public charging pole deployment in The Netherlands (more than 1M sessions). We rigorously analyze the collected data and quantify aforementioned flexibility: (1) we characterize the EV charging behavior by clustering the arrival and departure time combinations, identifying three behaviors (charging near home, charging near work, and park to charge), (2) we fit statistical models for the sojourn time, and flexibility (i.e., non-charging idle time) for each type of observed behavior, and (3) quantify the the potential of DR exploitation as the maximal load that could be achieved by coordinating EV charging for a given time of day t, continuously until t + \u0394.",

            "abstract": "Since the inception of smart grids, a substantial amount of research has focused on the development of scalable Demand Response (DR) approaches. For example, to flatten peak load, or to balance renewable energy production. A crucial assumption in DR is that at least some portion of the load is flexible, i.e., can be shifted in time. While the flexibility potential of smart devices has been analyzed extensively based on the device characteristics, little effort has been devoted to establishing potential factors in their owner's behavior. In this paper, we focus on sharpening the analysis of flexibility in residential user load and contribute with: (1) a quantitative specification of such flexibility, (2) a systematic methodology to derive a generative model for user flexibility behavior from data, (3) application of the methodology on a real-world data set from a field trial with smart appliances, and (4) analysis of factors determining that flexibility.",

            "abstract": "The Flemish project Linear was a large scale residential demand response pilot that aims to validate innovative smart grid technology building on the rollout of information and communication technologies in the power grid. For this pilot a scalable, reliable and interoperable ICT infrastructure was set up, interconnecting 240 residential power grid customers with the backend systems of energy service providers (ESPs), flexibility aggregators, distribution system operators (DSOs) and balancing responsible parties (BRPs). On top of this architecture several business cases were rolled out, which require the sharing of metering data and flexibility information, and demand response algorithms for the balancing of renewable energy and the mitigation of voltage and power issues in distribution grids. The goal of the pilot is the assessment of the technical and economical feasibility of residential demand response in real life, and of the interaction with the end-consumer. In this paper we focus on the practical experiences and lessons learnt during the deployment of the ICT technology for the pilot. This includes the real-time gathering of measurement data and real-time control of a wide range of smart appliances in the homes of the participants. We identified a number of critical issues that need to be addressed for a future full-scale roll-out: (i) reliable in-house communication, (ii) interoperability of appliances, measurement equipment, backend systems, and business cases, and (iii) sufficient backend processing power for real-time analysis and control.",

            "abstract": "To realize the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, tools are needed to ease the development and deployment of practical applications. Several standard bodies, companies, and ad-hoc consortia are proposing their own solution for inter-device communication. In this context, DYnamic, Adaptive MAnagement of Networks and Devices (DYAMAND) was presented in a previous publication to solve the interoperability issues introduced by the multitude of available technologies. In this paper a DYAMAND case study is presented: in cooperation with a large company, a monitoring application was developed for flexible office spaces in order to reliably reorganize an office environment and give real-time feedback on the usage of meeting rooms. Three wireless sensor technologies were investigated to be used in the pilot. The solution was deployed in a \"friendly user\" setting at a research institute (iMinds) prior to deployment at the large company's premises. Based on the findings of both installations, requirements for an application platform supporting development and management of smart (office) applications were listed. DYAMAND was used as the basis of the implementation. Although the local management of networked devices as provided by DYAMAND enables easier development of intelligent applications, a number of remote services discussed in this paper are needed to enable reliable and up-to-date support (of new technologies).",

One of these challenges is the increased risk for grid congestion issues due to the installation of large amounts of e.g. solar panels and wind turbines to the existing grid. As alternative to costly grid reinforcements several Active Network Management (ANM) techniques to mitigate this risk are researched, including (1) dynamic line rating and (2) demand side management. In this paper, we make an economic evaluation of those options from a Distribution System Operator (DSO) perspective. We discuss the aforementioned techniques and elaborate their business case for a specific use case in the MV-grid. Our calculations show that dynamic line rating can be considered as an alternative to network reinforcement, depending on the regulatory framework.",

            "abstract": "Future smart grids will combine power grid technologies with information and communication technologies to enable a more efficient, reliable and sustainable energy production and distribution. To realize such a smart grid, large scale pilot projects are currently implemented and evaluated. Such pilot projects generate an excessive amount of data that needs to be processed: energy measurements, information on available flexibility from smart devices that can be shifted in time, control signals, dynamic prices, environmental data, etc. To validate and analyze the gathered data and adjust the running experiments in real-time, an optimized data management infrastructure is needed as well as comprehensive visualization tools. In this paper we present a data management infrastructure optimized for the follow up of the large scale smart grid project called Linear. In this project a pilot in over 200 households is implemented to evaluate several business cases including the balancing of renewable energy supply and the mitigation of voltage and power issues in distribution grids. By decoupling the gathering of the incoming data, the processing and storage of the data, and the data visualization and analysis on different servers, each with their own, optimized database, we obtain an efficient system for validation of the generated data in the pilot, management of the deployed set-ups and follow-up of the ongoing experiments in real-time.",

            "abstract": "Distributed renewable power generators, such as solar cells and wind turbines are difficult to predict, making the demand-supply problem more complex than in the traditional energy production scenario. They also introduce bidirectional energy flows in the low-voltage power grid, possibly causing voltage violations and grid instabilities. In this article we describe a distributed algorithm for residential energy management in smart power grids. This algorithm consists of a market-oriented multi-agent system using virtual energy prices, levels of renewable energy in the real-time production mix, and historical price information, to achieve a shifting of loads to periods with a high production of renewable energy. Evaluations in our smart grid simulator for three scenarios show that the designed algorithm is capable of improving the self consumption of renewable energy in a residential area and reducing the average and peak loads for externally supplied power.",
