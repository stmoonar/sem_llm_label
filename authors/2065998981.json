            "abstract": "In wireless networks, meeting the performance requirements of all tasks solely with Internet of Things (IoT) devices is challenging due to their limited computational power and battery capacity. Given their flexibility and mobility, the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the context of mobile edge computing (MEC) has garnered significant interest within the sector. However, UAVs also face constraints in terms of resources like storage and computational power. Therefore, it is vital to develop effective UAV assistance solutions to provide long-term demands of in-network services. The dynamic scheduling and computation offloading of UAVs is the subject of this article. Specifically, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm based on a greedy (DDPGG) strategy to jointly optimize dynamic scheduling, device association, and task allocation of UAVs, with the goal of minimizing the weighted sum of total system energy consumption and time delay. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem involving mixed integers. The simulation results demonstrate that the DDPGG algorithm we have proposed exhibits a higher level of performance in comparison to its competitors.",

            "abstract": "Supporting mobile edge computing (MEC) in satellite-terrestrial networks (STNs) provides essential offloading services for devices for the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in remote areas. However, when terrestrial demands for computing resources are high, the MEC servers on visible LEO satellites may suffer from insufficient capacity, while those on more distant LEO satellites remain underutilized. To address this issue, this article investigates cooperative task offloading across multiple LEO satellites within an MEC-based STN. We propose a Quality-of-Service (QoS)-aware offloading decision and resource allocation scheme supported by a software-defined network (SDN) for a STN architecture. This architecture integrates the LEO Walker constellation with satellite ground stations (SGSs), with the aim of providing edge computing services to IoT devices in remote areas. To meet the task\u2019s QoS requirements, the tasks can be offloaded to either SGS or LEO satellites within the constellation. To address the challenges of a vast state space and complex action space within the system, we introduce the QOS-aware multihop task offloading in satellite-terrestrial edge networks (OUTSIDE) algorithm, which combines the global search capabilities of genetic algorithms with the local refinement strengths of the Lagrangian multiplier method to minimize the total task computation latency while satisfying QoS demands. Finally, comparative analysis and simulation experiments were conducted. These demonstrate that the OUTSIDE algorithm outperforms other approaches in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.",

            "abstract": "Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is a computational paradigm which integrates Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) into vehicular environments. Task offloading in VEC enables tasks generated by vehicles to be offloaded to the nearby Roadside Units (RSU) or surrounding vehicles, thereby reducing computational latency and energy consumption. However, current task offloading schemes still face numerous challenges, such as varying scenarios, intricately highly dynamic network topologies, and demands for lower latency. In this paper, we introduce a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) offloading scheme, namely, a genetic algorithm Based adaptivE offloadiNg schEme For domaIn generalizaTion (BENEFIT). First, to deal with the problem of varying scenarios in VEC, we consider the Domain Generalization (DG) problem in trajectory prediction and employ causal inference to construct a generalized prediction model. This serves as a pre-processing step and simultaneously reduces the overall decision space of the system to assist offloading. Second, we put forth an adaptive model targeting the cumulative offloading cost to handle highly dynamic network topologies, which dynamically adjusts delay and energy coefficients in various scenarios to facilitate adaptive offloading. Finally, we utilize the enhanced Non-Uniform Genetic Algorithm (NUGA) for making offloading decisions with considering the limited resources and collaboration processes among vehicles. According to simulation results, our scheme effectively decreases the total cost of the system. The BENEFIT achieves a 3 percent cost savings with regard to other schemes.",

            "abstract": "Edge caching has emerged as a promising approach to meet explosive mobile data on 6G networks. One critical issue in edge caching is file popularity prediction. The federated learning (FL) based distributed algorithm is used to predict file popularity, which solves user privacy issues in centralized algorithms. However, due to the heterogeneity of user devices, the feedback time (i.e., the update and upload time of model parameters) is various for each user, which causes the feedback delay in the framework of FL-based edge caching. In this letter, we devise a feedback delay-tolerant proactive caching scheme (FLASH) based on FL in which each user utilizes hybrid filtering on stacked autoencoders to train the prediction model locally. Experimental results indicate that FLASH can effectively handle feedback delay and outperform counterpart algorithms in cache efficiency.",

            "abstract": "In the scenario of limited energy supply, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enabled communication systems must make efficient use of energy in order to provide long-term service. In this paper, we propose a global energy efficiency maximization (GREEN) strategy for multi-UAV enabled communication systems. In such systems, a group of UAVs communicates with their associated ground terminals (GTs) by using a UAV-enabled interference channel (UAV-IC). In particular, we optimize the UAVs\u2019 trajectory control by jointly considering both the communication throughput and the total energy consumption of the whole system. We aim to maximize the global energy efficiency (GEE) of a task for multi-UAV communications, in which the problem is challenging to optimally solve due to its non-convex nature and strongly coupled variables. To tackle this problem, first, we investigate and propose a global energy-efficient optimization problem based on the fly-hover-communicate protocol. Second, we extend our proposed solution from the single UAV-enabled system to multiple UAV-GT pairs cases. In addition, we consider the general scenario in which the UAVs also communicate while flying. Based on the successive convex approximation technique and the path discretization method, the GREEN strategy is designed for optimizing UAV trajectories in this scenario. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy can achieve significantly higher GEE than the benchmark schemes for multi-UAV enabled communications.",

            "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology to provide computational services to ground terminal devices (TDs) in remote areas or for emergency incidents with its flexibility and mobility. This paper aims to maximize the UAV\u2019s energy efficiency while considering the fairness of offloading. We formulate this optimization problem by jointly considering the UAV flight time, the UAV 3D trajectory, the TD binary offloading decisions, and the time allocated to TDs, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. The problem is transformed into two sub-problems and we propose a PDDQNLP (parametrized dueling deep Q-network and linear programming) algorithm based on the combination of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and linear programming (LP) to address them. For the first sub-problem, a DRL-based algorithm is used to optimize the TD offloading decisions, the UAV trajectory, and the UAV flight time. The action space is hybrid that contains discrete actions (e.g., binary offloading) and continuous actions (e.g., UAV flight time). Therefore, we parameterize the action space and propose the PDDQN algorithm, which combines the DDPG algorithm for handling the continuous action space and the Dueling DQN algorithm for handling the discrete action space. According to the solution obtained from the first sub-problem, the LP is used to adjust the time allocated to TDs in the second sub-problem. The numerical results show that the PDDQNLP algorithm outperforms its counterparts.",

            "abstract": "In network-unavailable environments, the path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) becomes constrained by limitations in their energy resources and computing capabilities within a predefined mission timeframe. Additional low-power flight control must be considered to effectively complete a flight mission. To support UAV path planning in network-unavailable environments, this paper proposes a multi-sensor self-adaptive scheduling and optimized depth deterministic strategy gradient (MAS-DDPG) algorithm. Specifically, unlike considering activating all sensors in varying scenarios, a multi-sensor self-adaptive scheduling (MAS) strategy based on Multi-nominal Logit (MNL) is proposed. This approach allows the UAV to choose an appropriate scheduling strategy according to different scenarios. Furthermore, instead of relying on randomly chosen experiences from a pool, a mechanism based on screening experience is proposed. This mechanism takes into account successful experiences along with their contextual counterparts to enhance the learning process. Our goal is to maximize the average flight speed of the UAV and minimize the number of flight decisions and flight energy consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve significantly hinter speed and lower energy consumption than the benchmark and other typical algorithms.",

            "abstract": "The software-defined vehicular networking (SDVN) paradigm alleviates the deficiencies brought on by distributed vehicular. The separation of the control plane and the data plane allows the controller to manage the network based on global information. Most existing routing schemes in SDVN obtain the link-state through which vehicles periodically send beacon messages to the controller. However, due to the high mobility of the vehicles and the dynamic communication environment, the link-state changes within the beacon interval. In this case, the controller may select an expired link to transmit data during routing calculation, which will undoubtedly result in packet loss. Therefore, it is important for the controller to timely obtain the link-state during the beacon interval. If the controller can timely obtain the information after a link becomes unavailable, the risk of selecting unavailable links can be significantly reduced. In this paper, we propose an adaptive link-state perception scheme (ALPS) for SDVN, which enables the controller timely obtain the link-state within the beacon interval. We obtain the link-state by detecting the loss of packets on a link. A link quality evaluation method based on fuzzy logic is present to evaluate the possibility of link failure. After the link evaluation, we present an adaptive threshold adjustment method to dynamically adjust the detection range to decrease the detection cost. Simulation results demonstrate that ALPS can effectively reduce the packet loss ratio at a low cost.",

            "abstract": "Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is embarking on a new development road, in which Digital Twins (DT) provides crucial support for improving the smartness standard of vehicles and realizing a high-level of traffic management in this process. However, the existing solutions face challenges such as limited computing resources, data scarcity and data distribution, which hinder the application prospects of DT for ITS. First, we propose the concept of future-oriented DT aim to address these issues. Specifically, lightweight local DTs are deployed at the different edge servers to provide services for vehicles, and a strong performance global DT is deployed in the cloud server to manage and optimize the local DTs. Then, we introduce a collaborative learning method between two models to construct the DT network architecture and realize the vision of the future-oriented. This method makes use of rich global knowledge and local data, so that the model can dexterously integrate personalization and generalization capabilities. Finally, We use an Incremental Learning algorithm to improve the ability of the model that adapt to new scenarios and changing input data. All experiments are based on real traffic data, and trajectory prediction task as application carrier. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the stability and performance of DTs have achieved excellent performance in the construction process.",

            "abstract": "Device-to-device (D2D) content caching is a promising technology to mitigate the backhaul pressure, and reduce the contents transmission delay. In this paper, to improve the content hit rate (CHR) and the utilization efficiency of the limited caching capacity, we put forward a caching content placement strategy by predicting the user preference and the content popularity, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are introduced into the D2D networks to provide computation offloading services to the users. A dynamic resource allocation optimization algorithm (DRAOA) is proposed to deploy UAVs and plan UAVs trajectory adaptively according to the users' task requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed caching content placement policy outperforms the existing baselines. Additionally, the DRAOA can effectively improve the network capacity and mitigate the computation delay compared to the other two DRL algorithms.",
