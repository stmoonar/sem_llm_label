            "abstract": "Fast and high-accuracy detection of underwater targets based on side scan sonar images has great potential for marine fisheries, underwater security, marine mapping, underwater engineering and other applications. The following problems, however, must be addressed when using low-resolution side scan sonar images for underwater target detection: (1) the detection performance is limited due to the restriction on the input of multi-scale images; (2) the widely used deep learning algorithms have a low detection effect due to their complex convolution layer structures; (3) the detection performance is limited due to insufficient model complexity in training process; and (4) the number of samples is not enough because of the bad dataset preprocessing methods. To solve these problems, an improved neural network for underwater target detection\u2014which is based on side scan sonar images and fully utilizes spatial pyramid pooling and online dataset preprocessing based on the You Look Only Once version three (YOLO V3) algorithm\u2014is proposed. The methodology of the proposed approach is as follows: (1) the AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGGNet and the ResNet networks and an adopted YOLO V3 algorithm were the backbone networks. The structure of the YOLO V3 model is more mature and compact and has higher target detection accuracy and better detection efficiency than the other models; (2) spatial pyramid pooling was added at the end of the convolution layer to improve detection performance. Spatial pyramid pooling breaks the scale restrictions when inputting images to improve feature extraction because spatial pyramid pooling enables the backbone network to learn faster at high accuracy; and (3) online dataset preprocessing based on YOLO V3 with spatial pyramid pooling increases the number of samples and improves the complexity of the model to further improve detection process performance. Three-side scan imagery datasets were used for training and were tested in experiments. The quantitative evaluation using Accuracy, Recall, Precision, mAP and F1-Score metrics indicates that: for the AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGGNet and ResNet algorithms, when spatial pyramid pooling is added to their backbone networks, the average detection accuracy of the three sets of data was improved by 2%, 4%, 2% and 2%, respectively, as compared to their original formulations. Compared with the original YOLO V3 model, the proposed ODP+YOLO V3+SPP underwater target detection algorithm model has improved detection performance through the mAP qualitative evaluation index has increased by 6%, the Precision qualitative evaluation index has increased by 13%, and the detection efficiency has increased by 9.34%. These demonstrate that adding spatial pyramid pooling and online dataset preprocessing can improve the target detection accuracy of these commonly used algorithms. The proposed, improved neural network with spatial pyramid pooling and online dataset preprocessing based on the YOLO V3 method achieves the highest scores for underwater target detection results for sunken ships, fish flocks and seafloor topography, with mAP scores of 98%, 91% and 96% for the above three kinds of datasets, respectively.",

            "title": "Determination of Optimum Tie Point Interval for SAR Image Coregistration by Decomposing Autocorrelation Coefficient",
            "abstract": "Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a well-established technique for the generation of digital elevation models and/or the measurement of ground surface deformations. In InSAR data processing, the first step is the image coregistration achieved by using a set of tie points which are the conjugate image points on both master and slave images. To achieve reliable coregistration, a set of points is used instead of a single point. The interval of tie points, i.e., tie point density, will greatly affect the reliability of the coregistration. Hitherto, there have been no effective methods for the determination of optimum tie point interval for the purpose. In practice, this parameter is determined by experience. In this paper, a method for determination of optimum tie point interval is presented based on theoretical analysis of autocorrelation coefficient of SAR image, which reflects the similarity between image pixels. After computation of autocorrelation coefficient in range and azimuth, it is decomposed into low and high frequencies by a wavelet transform. Then, by a combined analysis of the variations of wave amplitudes with distance, the optimum interval for tie point matching can be determined. It is found that the optimum tie point interval in azimuth and range can be different. Two pairs of SAR images acquired by different platforms are used to validate the proposed method. An optimum tie point interval can be determined in this way for any pair of SAR images.",

            "abstract": "Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is an effective feature extraction algorithm. Inspired by the visual cortex sparse representation, sparsity is introduced into RBM to get sparse representation. In the paper, the Lorentz function is introduced to RBM to construct constrained sparse RBM model (LRBM) to improve RBM. The experimental results show that the LRBM model can effectively extract the feature information. The average classification rate increases by 2% than that of RBM.",
