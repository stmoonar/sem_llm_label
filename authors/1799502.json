            "abstract": "The full exploitation of scholarly repositories is pivotal in modern Open Science, and scholarly repository registries are kingpins in enabling researchers and research infrastructures to list and search for suitable repositories. However, since multiple registries exist, repository managers are keen on registering multiple times the repositories they manage to maximise their traction and visibility across different research communities, disciplines, and applications. These multiple registrations ultimately lead to information fragmentation and redundancy on the one hand and, on the other, force registries' users to juggle multiple registries, profiles and identifiers describing the same repository. Such problems are known to registries, which claim equivalence between repository profiles whenever possible by cross-referencing their identifiers across different registries. However, as we will see, this ``claim set'' is far from complete and, therefore, many replicas slip under the radar, possibly creating problems downstream. In this work, we combine such claims to create duplicate sets and extend them with the results of an automated clustering algorithm run over repository metadata descriptions. Then we manually validate our results to produce an ``as accurate as possible'' de-duplicated dataset of scholarly repositories.",

            "abstract": "Open Access (OA) publishing is the set of practices thanks to which research publications are accessible freely without barriers. With Diamond Open Access, authors can publish free of charge as the institutional sector with universities, research institutions or libraries provide the necessary technological infrastructure. However, the Diamond OA landscape continues to be fragmented, is often underfunded, and is not always technically proficient enough to develop its full potential for science and society. The CRAFT-OA project, started in January 2023, aims to consolidate the Diamond OA publishing landscape both from the technical and organisational point of views. In this paper we describe the context and architecture of the Diamond Discovery Hub that will be released by the project to increase visibility, discoverability and recognition of Diamond OA institutional publishers and their content. The Diamond Discovery Hub will facilitate the integration with the wider scholarly communication ecosystem and the European Open Science Cloud to enlarge visibility, discoverability and reach of open access publications as part of the emerging Open Science paradigm.",

            "abstract": "The International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge: Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023) is now running its third edition. The Sci-K workshop is a venue that brings together researchers and practitioners from different disciplines (including, but not limited to, Digital Libraries, Information Extraction, Machine Learning, Semantic Web, Knowledge Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Scholarly Communication, Science of Science, Scientometrics and Bibliometrics), as well as professionals from the industry, to explore innovative solutions and ideas for the production and consumption of Scientific Knowledge Graphs and assessing the research impact. The workshop has called for high-quality submissions around the three main themes of research, related to scientific knowledge: representation, discovery, and assessment. In response to the call for papers, the workshop has received outstanding submissions from researchers in 15 different countries: United States of America, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Canada, India, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Denmark, Ethiopia, and Norway. Each paper was reviewed at least by three members of the programme committee. Given the quality and the interesting topics covered by the submissions, we accepted 10 papers. Sci-K 2023 builds on two previous successful editions and keeps attracting a combined pool of attendees. The first edition (Sci-K 2021), was held on 13 April 2021 in conjunction with The Web Conference 2021. Its program consisted of two keynote talks, and the presentation of 11 research papers. The second edition (Sci-K 2022) took place on the 26 April 2022 at The Web Conference 2022. The program included the presentation of 5 long papers, 4 short papers, 2 vision papers, 2 keynote speeches and a panel on \u201cWhat\u2019s next after Microsoft Academic Graph?\u201d. The full program as well as the list of accepted papers can be found on the Sci-K website: https://sci-k.github.io/2023/.",

            "abstract": "In the last decade, scholarly graphs became fundamental to storing and managing scholarly knowledge in a structured and machine-readable way. Methods and tools for discovery and impact assessment of science rely on such graphs and their quality to serve scientists, policymakers, and publishers. Since research data became very important in scholarly communication, scholarly graphs started including dataset metadata and their relationships to publications. Such graphs are the foundations for Open Science investigations, data-article publishing workflows, discovery, and assessment indicators. However, due to the heterogeneity of practices (FAIRness is indeed in the making), they often lack the complete and reliable metadata necessary to perform accurate data analysis; e.g., dataset metadata is inaccurate, author names are not uniform, and the semantics of the relationships is unknown, ambiguous or incomplete. This work describes an open and curated scholarly graph we built and published as a training and test set for data discovery, data connection, author disambiguation, and link prediction tasks. Overall the graph contains 4,047 publications, 5,488 datasets, 22 software, 21,561 authors; 9,692 edges interconnect publications to datasets and software and are labeled with semantics that outline whether a publication is citing, referencing, documenting, supplementing another product. To ensure high-quality metadata and semantics, we relied on the information extracted from PDFs of the publications and the datasets and software webpages to curate and enrich nodes metadata and edges semantics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever published resource, including publications and datasets with manually validated and curated metadata.",

            "abstract": "Introduction While, in early science, most of the papers were authored by a handful of scientists, modern science is characterised by more extensive collaborations, and the average number of authors per article has increased across many disciplines (Baethge, 2008; Cronin, 2001; Fernandes & Monteiro, 2017; Frandsen & Nicolaisen, 2010; Wren et al., 2007). Indeed, in some fields of science (e.g., High Energy Physics), it is not infrequent to encounter hundreds or thousands of authors co-participating in the same piece of research2. Such intricate collaboration patterns make it difficult to establish a correct relationship between contributor and scientific contribution and hence get an accurate and fair reward during research evaluation (Brand, Allen, Altman, Hlava, & Scott, 2015; Vasilevsky et al., 2021; Vergoulis et al., 2022). Thus, as widely known, scientific authorship tends to be a rather hot-button topic in academia, as roughly one-fifth of academic disputes among authors stem from this (Dance, 2012).",

            "abstract": ". Scholarly repositories are the cornerstone of modern open science, and their availability is vital for enacting its practices. To this end, scholarly registries such as FAIRsharing, re3data, OpenDOAR and ROAR give them presence and visibility across di\ufb00erent research commu-nities, disciplines, and applications by assigning an identi\ufb01er and persist-ing their pro\ufb01les with summary metadata. Alas, like any other resource available on the Web, scholarly repositories, be they tailored for litera-ture, software or data, are quite dynamic and can be frequently changed, moved, merged or discontinued. Therefore, their references are prone to link rot over time, and their availability often boils down to whether the homepage URLs indicated in authoritative repository pro\ufb01les within scholarly registries respond or not. For this study, we harvested the content of four prominent scholarly registries and resolved over 13 thousand unique repository URLs. By per-forming a quantitative analysis on such an extensive collection of repositories, this paper aims to provide a global snapshot of their availability, which bewilderingly is far from granted.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, a lot of data is in the form of Knowledge Graphs aiming at representing information as a set of nodes and relationships between them. This paper proposes an efficient framework to create informative embeddings for node classification on large knowledge graphs. Such embeddings capture how a particular node of the graph interacts with his neighborhood and indicate if it is either isolated or part of a bigger clique. Since a homogeneous graph is necessary to perform this kind of analysis, the framework exploits the metapath approach to split the heterogeneous graph into multiple homogeneous graphs. The proposed pipeline includes an unsupervised attentive neural network to merge different metapaths and produce node embeddings suitable for classification. Preliminary experiments on the IMDb dataset demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach, which can defeat current state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.",
