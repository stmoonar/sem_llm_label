            "abstract": "In this work, we study disagreement in discussions around Wikidata, an online knowledge community that builds the data backend of Wikipedia. Discussions are important in collaborative work as they can increase contributor performance and encourage the emergence of shared norms and practices. While disagreements can play a productive role in discussions, they can also lead to conflicts and controversies, which impact contributor well-being and their motivation to engage. We want to understand if and when such phenomena arise in Wikidata, using a mix of quantitative and qualitative analyses to identify the types of topics people disagree about, the most common patterns of interaction, and roles people play when arguing for or against an issue. We find that decisions to create Wikidata properties are much faster than those to delete properties and that more than half of controversial discussions do not lead to consensus. Our analysis suggests that Wikidata is an inclusive community, considering different opinions when making decisions, and that conflict and vandalism are rare in discussions. At the same time, while one-fourth of the editors participating in controversial discussions contribute with legit and insightful opinions about Wikidata's emerging issues, they do not remain engaged in the discussions. We hope our findings will help Wikidata support community decision making, and improve discussion tools and practices.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured representation of data in the form of relations between different entities. The semantics of relations between words and entities are often ambiguous, where it is common to find polysemous relations that represent multiple semantics based on the context. This ambiguity in relation semantics also proliferates KG triples. While the guidance from custom-designed ontologies addresses this issue to some extent, our analysis shows that the heterogeneity and complexity of real-world data still results in substantial relation polysemy within popular KGs. The correct semantic interpretation of KG relations is necessary for many downstream applications such as entity classification and question answering. We present the problem of fine-grained relation discovery and a data-driven method towards this task that leverages the vector representations of the knowledge graph entities and relations available from relational learning models. We show that by performing clustering over these vectors, our method is able to not only identify the polysemous relations in knowledge graphs, but also discover the different semantics associated with them. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that fine-grained relations discovered by the proposed approach lead to substantial improvement in the semantics in the Yago and NELL datasets, as compared to baselines. Additional insights from qualitative analyses convey that fine-grained relation discovery is an important yet complex task, especially in the presence of complex ontologies and noisy data.",

            "abstract": "As machine learning techniques are being increasingly employed for text processing tasks, the need for training data has become a major bottleneck for their application. Manual generation of large scale training datasets tailored to each task is a time consuming and expensive process, which necessitates their automated generation. In this work, we turn our attention towards creation of training datasets for named entity recognition (NER) in the context of the cultural heritage domain. NER plays an important role in many natural language processing systems. Most NER systems are typically limited to a few common named entity types, such as person, location, and organization. However, for cultural heritage resources, such as digitized art archives, the recognition of fine-grained entity types such as titles of artworks is of high importance. Current state of the art tools are unable to adequately identify artwork titles due to unavailability of relevant training datasets. We analyse the particular difficulties presented by this domain and motivate the need for quality annotations to train machine learning models for identification of artwork titles. We present a framework with heuristic based approach to create high-quality training data by leveraging existing cultural heritage resources from knowledge bases such as Wikidata. Experimental evaluation shows significant improvement over the baseline for NER performance for artwork titles when models are trained on the dataset generated using our framework.",

A wealth of information is buried in art-historic archives which can be extracted via digitization and analysis. This information can facilitate search and browsing, help art historians to track the provenance of artworks and enable wider semantic text exploration for digital cultural resources. However, this information is contained in images of artworks, as well as textual descriptions or annotations accompanied with the images. During the digitization of such resources, the valuable associations between the images and texts are frequently lost. In this project description, we propose an approach to retrieve the associations between images and texts for artworks from art-historic archives. To this end, we use machine learning to generate text descriptions for the extracted images on the one hand, and to detect descriptive phrases and titles of images from the text on the other hand. Finally, we use embeddings to align both, the descriptions and the images.",

            "abstract": "Virtualization is one of the important enabling technologies for Cloud Computing which facilitates sharing of resources among the virtual machines. However, it incurs performance overheads due to contention of physical devices such as disk and network bandwidth. Various I/O applications having different latency requirements may be executing concurrently on different virtual machines provisioned on a single server in Cloud data-centers. It is pertinent that the performance SLAs of such applications are satisfied through intelligent scheduling and allocation of disk resources. The underlying disk scheduler at the server is unable to distinguish between the application requests being oblivious to the characteristics of these applications. Therefore, all the applications are provided best effort services by default. This may lead to performance degradation for the latency sensitive applications. In this work, we propose a novel disk scheduling framework PriDyn (Dynamic Priority) which provides differentiated services to various I/O applications co-located on a single host based on their latency attributes and desired performance. The framework employs a scheduling algorithm which dynamically computes latency estimates for all concurrent I/O applications for a given system state. Based on these, an appropriate priority assignment for the applications is determined which is taken into consideration by the underlying disk scheduler at the host while scheduling the I/O applications on the physical disk. The proposed scheduling framework is able to successfully satisfy QoS requirements for the concurrent I/O applications within system constraints. This has been verified through extensive experimental analysis. In order to realize the benefits of differentiated services provided by the PriDyn scheduler, proper combination of I/O applications must be ensured for the servers through intelligent meta-scheduling techniques at the Cloud data-center level. For achieving this, in the second part of this work, we extended the PriDyn framework to design a proactive admission control and scheduling framework PCOS (Prescient C loud I/O Scheduler).

It has proven to be very advantageous for a wide range of industries in the emerging markets by allowing them to match the infrastructure capabilities of their already established competitors. However, Cloud computing also poses several unique challenges in terms of resource allocation and scheduling. In particular, I/O bound applications have been mostly neglected in the research efforts in the area. Simulation tools play a key role in the evaluation of new resource management policies by providing an affordable and replicable testing environment. In this paper, we propose a novel simulation framework PriDynSim for priority based I/O policies, which manage the available resources to ensure adequate performance in the presence of deadline constraints. In a case study, we demonstrate how PriDynSim can be used to evaluate a resource management policy, which guarantees Quality of Service (QoS) for I/O bound applications running in a typical Cloud environment.",
