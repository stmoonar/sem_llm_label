            "title": "Hybrid Text Representation for Explainable Suicide Risk Identification on Social Media",
            "abstract": "Social media data that characterize users can provide mental health signals, including suicide risks. Existing methods for suicide risk identification on social media have demonstrated promising results; however, the limitation of existing methods is that they are unable to capture low- and high-level features with complex structured data on social media and are incapable of explaining the predicted labels. Explainable models are more useful when translated, so we aimed to evaluate a novel method that would produce explainable models. This article presents a hybrid text representation method that integrates word and document-level text representations to explain suicide risk identification on social media. The proposed method is then fed to a transformer-based encoder with ordinal classification to determine suicide risk. Our results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with an FScore of 0.79 (an absolute increase of 15%) on a public suicide dataset. Our method shows that an explainable model can perform at a comparable level to the best nonexplainable models but has advantages if translated for use in clinical and public health practice.",

            "abstract": "The widespread use of social media for expressing personal thoughts and emotions makes it a valuable resource for identifying individuals at risk of suicide. Existing sequential learning-based methods have shown promising results. However, these methods may fail to capture global features. Due to its inherent ability to learn interconnected data, graph-based methods can address this gap. In this paper, we present a new graph-based hierarchical attention network (GHAN) that uses a graph convolutional neural network with an ordinal loss to improve suicide risk identification on social media. Specifically, GHAN first captures global features by constructing three graphs to capture semantic, syntactic, and sequential contextual information. Then encoded textual features are fed to attentive transformers\u2019 encoder and optimized to factor in the increasing suicide risk levels using an ordinal classification layer hierarchically for suicide risk detection. Experimental results show that the proposed GHAN outperformed state-of-the-art methods on a public Reddit dataset.",

            "abstract": "Pathology imaging is routinely used to detect the underlying effects and causes of diseases or injuries. Pathology visual question answering (PathVQA) aims to enable computers to answer questions about clinical visual findings from pathology images.

In this article, we present a knowledge-driven PathVQA (K-PathVQA), which uses a medical knowledge graph (KG) from a complementary external structured knowledge base to infer answers for the PathVQA task. K-PathVQA improves the question representation with external medical knowledge and then aggregates vision, language, and knowledge embeddings to learn a joint knowledge-image-question representation. Our experiments using a publicly available PathVQA dataset showed that our K-PathVQA outperformed the best baseline method with an increase of 4.15% in accuracy for the overall task, an increase of 4.40% in open-ended question type and an absolute increase of 1.03% in closed-ended question types. Ablation testing shows the impact of each of the contributions. Generalizability of the method is demonstrated with a separate medical VQA dataset.",

            "abstract": "People often discuss their health on social media platforms. Discussion of personal experiences with diseases and symptoms can be useful in public health applications like adverse event surveillance. A major challenge comes from the need to distinguish personal health mentions from other uses of those terms, including figurative use, where words are used to mean something different. Public health applications require the separation of personal health mentions from other uses. Prior approaches incorporate some elements of context but could be improved to capture relationships between the linguistic characteristics of figurative expressions and the representations of the context. In this work, we investigate the role of context representation for identifying personal health mentions on social media and measure the impact of different representation choices on detecting figurative use of a range of disease and symptom words. We present an end-to-end approach that selects representations adaptively for different disease or symptom words. We conduct experiments using a publicly available health-mention dataset, annotated with ten disease or symptom labels. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state of the art (SOTA) in the identification of figurative language use across a range of disease or symptom words, with an F1-score of 0.925 (an increase of 10.7% over the SOTA) and the proportion of correctly identified figurative mentions was 0.923 (an increase of 16.7% over the SOTA). An ablation analysis demonstrates that each of the new modules contributes to this increased performance.",

For the advancement of HMC research, in this study, we present a Reddit health mention dataset (RHMD), a new dataset of multi-domain Reddit data for the HMC. RHMD is composed of 10015 manually annotated Reddit posts that include 15 common disease or symptom terms and are labeled with four labels: personal health mentions (HMs), nonpersonal HMs, figurative HMs, and hyperbolic HMs. Empirical evaluation using recently proposed methods demonstrates the challenge of labeling user-generated text across these four types. Contributions to this work include the public release of a robustly annotated Reddit dataset (RHMD) for HM tasks and a comprehensive performance analysis of baseline methods. We expect the release of the dataset, and the evaluations will help facilitate the development of new methods for detecting HMs in the user-generated text.

            "abstract": "Memes can be a useful way to spread information because they are funny, easy to share, and can spread quickly and reach further than other forms. With increased interest in COVID-19 vaccines, vaccination-related memes have grown in number and reach. Memes analysis can be difficult because they use sarcasm and often require contextual understanding. Previous research has shown promising results but could be improved by capturing global and local representations within memes to model contextual information. Further, the limited public availability of annotated vaccine critical memes datasets limit our ability to design computational methods to help design targeted interventions and boost vaccine uptake. To address these gaps, we present VaxMeme, which consists of 10,244 manually labelled memes. With VaxMeme, we propose a new multimodal framework designed to improve the memes' representation by learning the global and local representations of memes. The improved memes' representations are then fed to an attentive representation learning module to capture contextual information for classification using an optimised loss function. Experimental results show that our framework outperformed state-of-the-art methods with an F1-Score of 84.2%. We further analyse the transferability and generalisability of our framework and show that understanding both modalities is important to identify vaccine critical memes on Twitter. Finally, we discuss how understanding memes can be useful in designing shareable vaccination promotion, myth debunking memes and monitoring their uptake on social media platforms.",

            "abstract": "In modern cyber-physical systems, the vast interconnected processes generated from sensor networks necessitate advanced modeling techniques to exploit decentralized data considering edge computation and data access issues. As sensors emit correlated real-life time series, successful forecasting hinges on revealing the spatio-temporal structures and qualities of data. Matrix Estimation-based (ME) methods, as state-of-the-art techniques, excel at denoising and forecasting high-dimensional correlated time series by representing spatio-temporal data as a temporal matrix. However, ME methods face challenges in handling the decentralized data and access restrictions, due to existing licensing agreements and the inherent burden of centralized modeling. To address this limitation, we propose the Federated Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis (Fed-mSSA), a federated matrix estimation-based framework, to denoise and predict correlated time series in the presence of noisy and decentralized data. Specifically, we introduce a novel consensus optimization problem to jointly learn the low-rank matrix representation, capturing spatio-temporal patterns to recover latent states and missing data. Furthermore, we present a federated prediction method that privately and efficiently extracts non-linear temporal dynamics using the denoised temporal matrix. Our results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance in a distributed setting, particularly in the presence of missing data",

Alcohol abuse, dementia, depression, drug abuse and psychoses are common mental health issues that have been found to have to impact on an individual's physical health. This study proposed a risk prediction model based on administrative data that assesses the risk of mental health issues using a machine learning on graphs technique. For this purpose, a patient network is built from two cohorts (i.e., patients with mental health issues and patients without mental health issues) using the bipartite graph projection technique. We then use graph neural network (GNN) models and test various edge types (i.e., simple weighting, Jaccard index and overlap weighting) to predict the risk of mental health issues. The GNN models show outstanding performance compared to baseline models, and the accuracy ranged from 85.08% to 90.59%. Moreover, the pattern for the two cohorts can be demonstrated by visualising the last hidden layers of GNN models using the principal component analysis technique, confirming the discriminative strength of the GNN models. The proposed risk prediction framework could help medical practitioners and other stakeholders build health management strategies for people at high risk of acquiring mental health issues.",

            "abstract": "User-generated text on social media is a promising avenue for public health surveillance and has been actively explored for its feasibility in the early identification of depression. Existing methods in the identification of depression have shown promising results; however, these methods were all focused on treating the identification as a binary classification problem. To date, there has been little effort towards identifying users\u2019 depression severity level and disregard the inherent ordinal nature across these fine-grain levels. This paper aims to make early identification of depression severity levels on social media data. To accomplish this, we built a new dataset based on the inherent ordinal nature over depression severity levels using clinical depression standards on Reddit posts. The posts were classified into 4 depression severity levels covering the clinical depression standards on social media. Accordingly, we reformulate the early identification of depression as an ordinal classification task over clinical depression standards such as Beck\u2019s Depression Inventory and the Depressive Disorder Annotation scheme to identify depression severity levels. With these, we propose a hierarchical attention method optimized to factor in the increasing depression severity levels through a soft probability distribution. We experimented using two datasets (a public dataset having more than one post from each user and our built dataset with a single user post) using real-world Reddit posts that have been classified according to questionnaires built by clinical experts and demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the minimum number of posts required to identify depression severity level followed by a discussion of empirical and practical considerations of our study.",

            "title": "Benchmarking for Public Health Surveillance tasks on Social Media with a Domain-Specific Pretrained Language Model",
            "abstract": "A user-generated text on social media enables health workers to keep track of information, identify possible outbreaks, forecast disease trends, monitor emergency cases, and ascertain disease awareness and response to official health correspondence. This exchange of health information on social media has been regarded as an attempt to enhance public health surveillance (PHS). Despite its potential, the technology is still in its early stages and is not ready for widespread application. Advancements in pretrained language models (PLMs) have facilitated the development of several domain-specific PLMs and a variety of downstream applications. However, there are no PLMs for social media tasks involving PHS. We present and release PHS-BERT, a transformer-based PLM, to identify tasks related to public health surveillance on social media. We compared and benchmarked the performance of PHS-BERT on 25 datasets from different social medial platforms related to 7 different PHS tasks. Compared with existing PLMs that are mainly evaluated on limited tasks, PHS-BERT achieved state-of-the-art performance on all 25 tested datasets, showing that our PLM is robust and generalizable in the common PHS tasks. By making PHS-BERT available, we aim to facilitate the community to reduce the computational cost and introduce new baselines for future works across various PHS-related tasks.",
