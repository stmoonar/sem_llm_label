            "title": "Generalized Weak Supervision for Neural Information Retrieval",
            "abstract": "Neural ranking models (NRMs) have demonstrated effective performance in several information retrieval (IR) tasks. However, training NRMs often requires large-scale training data, which is difficult and expensive to obtain. To address this issue, one can train NRMs via weak supervision, where a large dataset is automatically generated using an existing ranking model (called the weak labeler) for training NRMs. Weakly supervised NRMs can generalize from the observed data and significantly outperform the weak labeler. This paper generalizes this idea through an iterative re-labeling process, demonstrating that weakly supervised models can iteratively play the role of weak labeler and significantly improve ranking performance without using manually labeled data. The proposed Generalized Weak Supervision (GWS) solution is generic and orthogonal to the ranking model architecture. This paper offers four implementations of GWS: self-labeling, cross-labeling, joint cross- and self-labeling, and greedy multi-labeling. GWS also benefits from a query importance weighting mechanism based on query performance prediction methods to reduce noise in the generated training data. We further draw a theoretical connection between self-labeling and Expectation-Maximization. Our experiments on four retrieval benchmarks suggest that our implementations of GWS lead to substantial improvements compared to weak supervision if the weak labeler is sufficiently reliable.",

            "abstract": "In information retrieval (IR), domain adaptation is the process of adapting a retrieval model to a new domain whose data distribution is different from the source domain. Existing methods in this area focus on unsupervised domain adaptation where they have access to the target document collection or supervised (often few-shot) domain adaptation where they additionally have access to (limited) labeled data in the target domain. There also exists research on improving zero-shot performance of retrieval models with no adaptation. This paper introduces a new category of domain adaptation in IR that is as-yet unexplored. Here, similar to the zero-shot setting, we assume the retrieval model does not have access to the target document collection. In contrast, it does have access to a brief textual description that explains the target domain. We define a taxonomy of domain attributes in retrieval tasks to understand different properties of a source domain that can be adapted to a target domain. We introduce a novel automatic data construction pipeline that produces a synthetic document collection, query set, and pseudo relevance labels, given a textual domain description. Extensive experiments on five diverse target domains show that adapting dense retrieval models using the constructed synthetic data leads to effective retrieval performance on the target domain.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a novel semantic representation, WISeR, that overcomes challenges for Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). Despite its strengths, AMR is not easily applied to languages or domains without predefined semantic frames, and its use of numbered arguments results in semantic role labels, which are not directly interpretable and are semantically overloaded for parsers. We examine the numbered arguments of predicates in AMR and convert them to thematic roles that do not require reference to semantic frames. We create a new corpus of 1K English dialogue sentences annotated in both WISeR and AMR. WISeR shows stronger inter-annotator agreement for beginner and experienced annotators, with beginners becoming proficient in WISeR annotation more quickly. Finally, we train a state-of-the-art parser on the AMR 3.0 corpus and a WISeR corpus converted from AMR 3.0. The parser is evaluated on these corpora and our dialogue corpus. The WISeR model exhibits higher accuracy than its AMR counterpart across the board, demonstrating that WISeR is easier for parsers to learn.",

            "abstract": "Non-factoid question answering (NFQA) is a challenging and under-researched task that requires constructing long-form answers, such as explanations or opinions, to open-ended non-factoid questions - NFQs. There is still little understanding of the categories of NFQs that people tend to ask, what form of answers they expect to see in return, and what the key research challenges of each category are. This work presents the first comprehensive taxonomy of NFQ categories and the expected structure of answers. The taxonomy was constructed with a transparent methodology and extensively evaluated via crowdsourcing. The most challenging categories were identified through an editorial user study. We also release a dataset of categorised NFQs and a question category classifier. Finally, we conduct a quantitative analysis of the distribution of question categories using major NFQA datasets, showing that the NFQ categories that are the most challenging for current NFQA systems are poorly represented in these datasets. This imbalance may lead to insufficient system performance for challenging categories. The new taxonomy, along with the category classifier, will aid research in the area, helping to create more balanced benchmarks and to focus models on addressing specific categories.",

            "abstract": "Languages emerge and change over time at the population level though interactions between individual speakers. It is, however, hard to directly observe how a single speaker\u2019s linguistic innovation precipitates a population-wide change in the language, and many theoretical proposals exist. We introduce a very general mathematical model that encompasses a wide variety of individual-level linguistic behaviours and provides statistical predictions for the population-level changes that result from them. This model allows us to compare the likelihood of empirically-attested changes in definite and indefinite articles in multiple languages under different assumptions on the way in which individuals learn and use language. We find that accounts of language change that appeal primarily to errors in childhood language acquisition are very weakly supported by the historical data, whereas those that allow speakers to change incrementally across the lifespan are more plausible, particularly when combined with social network effects.",

            "abstract": "The rise in popularity of mobile and voice search has led to a shift in focus from document retrieval to short answer passage retrieval for non-factoid questions. Some of the questions have multiple answers, and the aim is to retrieve a set of relevant answer passages, which covers all these alternatives. Compared to documents, answers are more specific and typically form more defined types or groups. Grouping answer passages based on strong similarity measures may provide a means of identifying these types. Typically, kNN clustering in combination with term-based representations have been used in Information Retrieval (IR) scenarios. An alternate method is to use pre-trained distributional representations such as GloVe and BERT, which capture additional semantic relationships. The recent success of trained neural models for various tasks provides the motivation for generating more task-specific representations. However, due to the absence of large datasets for incorporating passage level similarity information, a more feasible alternative is to use weak supervision based training. This information can then be used to generate a final ranked list of diversified answers using standard diversification algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset NFPassageQA_Sim, with human annotated similarity labels for pairs of answer passages corresponding to each question. These similarity labels are then processed to generate another dataset NFPassageQA_Div, which consists of answer types for these questions. Using the similarity labels, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using weak supervision signals derived from GloVe, fine-tuned and trained using a BERT model for the task of answer passage clustering. Finally, we introduce a model which incorporates these clusters into a MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) model, which significantly beats other diversification baselines using both diversity and relevance metrics.",

            "abstract": "Existing commercial search engines often struggle to represent different perspectives of a search query. Argument retrieval systems address this limitation of search engines and provide both positive (PRO) and negative (CON) perspectives about a user's information need on a controversial topic (e.g., climate change). The effectiveness of such argument retrieval systems is typically evaluated based on topical relevance and argument quality, without taking into account the often differing number of documents shown for the argument stances (PRO or CON). Therefore, systems may retrieve relevant passages, but with a biased exposure of arguments. In this work, we analyze a range of non-stochastic fairness-aware ranking and diversity metrics to evaluate the extent to which argument stances are fairly exposed in argument retrieval systems. Using the official runs of the argument retrieval task Ttouch\u00e9 at CLEF 2020, as well as synthetic data to control the amount and order of argument stances in the rankings, we show that systems with the best effectiveness in terms of topical relevance are not necessarily the most fair or the most diverse in terms of argument stance. The relationships we found between (un)fairness and diversity metrics shed light on how to evaluate group fairness -- in addition to topical relevance -- in argument retrieval settings.",

The latter, instead, predicts the next apps that the users would want to launch. Here we focus on context-aware models to leverage the rich contextual information available to mobile devices. We design an in situ study to collect thousands of mobile queries enriched with mobile sensor data (now publicly available for research purposes). With the aid of this dataset, we study the user behavior in the context of these tasks and propose a family of context-aware neural models that take into account the sequential, temporal, and personal behavior of users.

            "abstract": "Representation learning has always played an important role in information retrieval (IR) systems. Most retrieval models, including recent neural approaches, use representations to calculate similarities between queries and documents to find relevant information from a corpus. Recent models use large-scale pre-trained language models for query representation. The typical use of these models, however, has a major limitation in that they generate only a single representation for a query, which may have multiple intents or facets. The focus of this paper is to address this limitation by considering neural models that support multiple intent representations for each query. Specifically, we propose the NMIR (Neural Multiple Intent Representations) model that can generate semantically different query intents and their appropriate representations. We evaluate our model on query facet generation using a large-scale dataset of real user queries sampled from the Bing search logs. We also provide an extrinsic evaluation of the proposed model using a clarifying question selection task. The results show that NMIR significantly outperforms competitive baselines.",

This taxonomy is more fine-grained than previous query taxonomies, and is designed with the ultimate goal of reducing the inherent ambiguity in determining the intent of questions. In addition, we describe the formal procedure for conducting an editorial study of the taxonomy including its evaluation. The adopted procedure aims to increase assessor agreement without incurring too much overhead.
