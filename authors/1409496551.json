            "abstract": "In this paper, we provide an overview of current technologies for cross-lingual link discovery, and we discuss challenges, experiences and prospects of their application to under-resourced languages. We rst introduce the goals of cross-lingual linking and associated technologies, and in particular, the role that the Linked Data paradigm (Bizer et al., 2011) applied to language data can play in this context. We de ne under-resourced languages with a speci c focus on languages actively used on the internet, i.e., languages with a digitally versatile speaker community, but limited support in terms of language technology. We argue that languages for which considerable amounts of textual data and (at least) a bilingual word list are available, techniques for cross-lingual linking can be readily applied, and that these enable the implementation of downstream applications for under-resourced languages via the localisation and adaptation of existing technologies and resources.",

            "abstract": "Since the inception of the Open Linguistics Working Group in 2010, there have been numerous efforts in transforming language resources into Linked Data. The research field of Linguistic Linked Data (LLD) has gained in importance, visibility and impact, with the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud gathering nowadays over 200 resources. With this increasing growth, new challenges have emerged concerning particular domain and task applications, quality dimensions, and linguistic features to take into account. This special issue aims to review and summarize the progress and status of LLD research in recent years, as well as to offer an understanding of the challenges ahead of the field for the years to come. The papers in this issue indicate that there are still aspects to address for a wider community adoption of LLD, as well as a lack of resources for specific tasks and (interdisciplinary) domains. Likewise, the integration of LLD resources into Natural Language Processing (NLP) architectures and the search for long-term infrastructure solutions to host LLD resources continue to be essential points to which to attend in the foreseeable future of the research line.",

The increasing uptake of Lemon illustrates the growing interest in combining linguistic information and Semantic Web technologies. In this paper, we present Fuzzy Lemon, an extension of Lemon that allows to assign an uncertainty degree to lexical semantic relations. Our approach is based on an OWL ontology that defines a hierarchy of data properties encoding different types of uncertainty. We also illustrate the usefulness of Fuzzy Lemon by showing that it can be used to represent the confidence degrees of automatically discovered translations between pairs of bilingual dictionaries from the Apertium family.",

            "abstract": "Recent years have experienced a growing trend in the publication of language resources as Linguistic Linked Data (LLD) to enhance their discovery, reuse and the interoperability of tools that consume language data. To this aim, the OntoLex-lemon model has emerged as a de facto standard to represent lexical data on the Web. However, traditional dictionaries contain a considerable amount of morphological information which is not straightforwardly representable as LLD within the current model. In order to fill this gap a new Morphology Module of OntoLex-lemon is currently being developed. This paper presents the results of this model as on-going work as well as the underlying challenges that emerged during the module development. Based on the MMoOn Core ontology, it aims to account for a wide range of morphological information, ranging from endings to derive whole paradigms to the decomposition and generation of lexical entries which is in compliance to other OntoLex-lemon modules and facilitates the encoding of complex morphological data in ontology lexicons.",

            "abstract": "Abstract As the interest of the Semantic Web and computational linguistics communities in linguistic linked data (LLD) keeps increasing and the number of contributions that dwell on LLD rapidly grows, scholars (and linguists in particular) interested in the development of LLD resources sometimes find it difficult to determine which mechanism is suitable for their needs and which challenges have already been addressed. This review seeks to present the state of the art on the models, ontologies and their extensions to represent language resources as LLD by focusing on the nature of the linguistic content they aim to encode. Four basic groups of models are distinguished in this work: models to represent the main elements of lexical resources (group 1), vocabularies developed as extensions to models in group 1 and ontologies that provide more granularity on specific levels of linguistic analysis (group 2), catalogues of linguistic data categories (group 3) and other models such as corpora models or service-oriented ones (group 4). Contributions encompassed in these four groups are described, highlighting their reuse by the community and the modelling challenges that are still to be faced.",

            "abstract": ". Dictionaries are increasingly being transformed into linguistic linked lata (LLD) relying on the lemon and OntoLex models, but this conversion is not always straightforward. For both linked data (LD) based applications to exploit all content provided in dictionaries and lexicographers adopting LD technologies, the original data and structure should be retrievable from the LLD version to prevent any loss of information in the transformation. In this position statement we motivate the need for a new module in OntoLex targeted at the representation of dictionaries and which will address structures and annotations commonly found in lexicography. Some of the issues we identi\ufb01ed in our initial experiences are presented as input for discussion, along with our initial approaches to solve them. Such a module is intended to be compatible with other modules in OntoLex and should guarantee information preservation, making LD a viable mechanism for lexicographers in the development of lexica.",

Current Semantic Web-based techniques enable the transformation and linking of those resources to become a navigable graph of linked language resources, which can be directly consumed by third-party applications. The prototype we have developed builds on a web user interface and SPARQL endpoint initially developed to query a single terminological database (Terminesp), now extended to navigate a set of multilingual terminologies. The vocabulary used to represent these terminologies into the linked data format is lemon-ontolex, a de facto standard for representing lexical information relative to ontologies and for linking lexicons and machine-readable dictionaries to the Semantic Web.",
