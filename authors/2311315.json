            "abstract": "Graph Transformers (GTs) have made remarkable achievements in graph-level tasks. However, most existing works regard graph structures as a form of guidance or bias for enhancing node representations, which focuses on node-central perspectives and lacks explicit representations of edges and structures. One natural question is, can we treat graph structures node-like as a whole to learn high-level features? Through experimental analysis, we explore the feasibility of this assumption. Based on our findings, we propose a novel multi-view graph representation learning model via structure-aware searching and coarsening (GRLsc) on GT architecture for graph classification. Specifically, we build three unique views, original, coarsening, and conversion, to learn a thorough structural representation. We compress loops and cliques via hierarchical heuristic graph coarsening and restrict them with well-designed constraints, which builds the coarsening view to learn high-level interactions between structures. We also introduce line graphs for edge embeddings and switch to edge-central perspective to construct the conversion view. Experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the improvements of GRLsc over 28 baselines from various architectures.",

            "abstract": "Graph representation learning (GRL) models have succeeded in many scenarios. Real-world graphs have imbalanced distribution, such as node labels and degrees, which leaves a critical challenge to GRL. Imbalanced inputs can lead to imbalanced outputs. However, most existing works ignore it and assume that the distribution of input graphs is balanced, which cannot align with real situations, resulting in worse model performance on tail data. The domination of head data makes tail data underrepresented when training graph neural networks (GNNs). Thus, we propose Graffin, a pluggable tail data augmentation module, to address the above issues. Inspired by recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Graffin flows head features into tail data through graph serialization techniques to alleviate the imbalance of tail representation. The local and global structures are fused to form the node representation under the combined effect of neighborhood and sequence information, which enriches the semantics of tail data. We validate the performance of Graffin on four real-world datasets in node classification tasks. Results show that Graffin can improve the adaptation to tail data without significantly degrading the overall model performance.",

            "abstract": "In the context of global energy strategy, accurate natural gas demand forecasting is crucial for ensuring efficient resource allocation and operational planning. Traditional forecasting methods struggle to cope with the growing complexity and variability of gas consumption patterns across diverse industries and commercial sectors. To address these challenges, we propose the first foundation model specifically tailored for natural gas demand forecasting. Foundation models, known for their ability to generalize across tasks and datasets, offer a robust solution to the limitations of traditional methods, such as the need for separate models for different customer segments and their limited generalization capabilities. Our approach leverages contrastive learning to improve prediction accuracy in real-world scenarios, particularly by tackling issues such as noise in historical consumption data and the potential misclassification of similar data samples, which can lead to degradation in the quaility of the representation and thus the accuracy of downstream forecasting tasks. By integrating advanced noise filtering techniques within the contrastive learning framework, our model enhances the quality of learned representations, leading to more accurate predictions. Furthermore, the model undergoes industry-specific fine-tuning during pretraining, enabling it to better capture the unique characteristics of gas consumption across various sectors. We conducted extensive experiments using a large-scale dataset from ENN Group, which includes data from over 10,000 industrial, commercial, and welfare-related customers across multiple regions. Our model outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating a relative improvement in MSE by 3.68\\% and in MASE by 6.15\\% compared to the best available model.",

            "abstract": "ICD coding is designed to assign the disease codes to electronic health records (EHRs) upon discharge, which is crucial for billing and clinical statistics. In an attempt to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of manual coding, many methods have been proposed to automatically predict ICD codes from clinical notes. However, most previous works ignore the decisive information contained in structured medical data in EHRs, which is hard to be captured from the noisy clinical notes. In this paper, we propose a Tree-enhanced Multimodal Attention Network (TreeMAN) to fuse tabular features and textual features into multimodal representations by enhancing the text representations with tree-based features via the attention mechanism. Tree-based features are constructed according to decision trees learned from structured multimodal medical data, which capture the decisive information about ICD coding. We can apply the same multi-label classifier from previous text models to the multimodal representations to predict ICD codes. Experiments on two MIMIC datasets show that our method outperforms prior state-of-the-art ICD coding approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/liu-zichen/TreeMAN.",

            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SR) gains increasing popularity because it helps greatly maintain users' privacy. Aside from its efficacy, explainability is also critical for developing a successful SR model, since it can improve the persuasiveness of the results, the users' satisfaction, and the debugging efficiency. However, the majority of current SR models are unexplainable and even those that claim to be interpretable cannot provide clear and convincing explanations of users' intentions and how they influence the models' decisions. To solve this problem, in this research, we propose a meta-path guided model which uses path instances to capture item dependencies, explicitly reveal the underlying motives, and illustrate the entire reasoning process. To begin with, our model explores meta-path guided instances and leverages the multi-head self-attention mechanism to disclose the hidden motivations beneath these path instances. To comprehensively model the user interest and interest shifting, we search paths in both adjacent and non-adjacent items. Then, we update item representations by incorporating the user-item interactions and meta-path-based context sequentially. Compared with recent strong baselines, our method is competent to the SOTA performance on three datasets and meanwhile provides sound and clear explanations.",

To resist the attack on IIoT applications, we propose the federated backdoor filter defense that can identify backdoor inputs and restore the data to availability by the blur-label-flipping strategy. We build multiple filters with eXplainable AI models on the server and send them to clients randomly, preventing advanced attackers from evading the defense. Our backdoor filters show significant backdoor recognition with the accuracy up to 99%.

            "abstract": "As an essential form of knowledge representation, taxonomies are widely used in various downstream natural language processing tasks. However, with the continuously rising of new concepts, many existing taxonomies are unable to maintain coverage by manual expansion. In this paper, we propose TEMP, a self-supervised taxonomy expansion method, which predicts the position of new concepts by ranking the generated taxonomy-paths. For the first time, TEMP employs pre-trained contextual encoders in taxonomy construction and hypernym detection problems. Experiments prove that pre-trained contextual embeddings are able to capture hypernym-hyponym relations. To learn more detailed differences between taxonomy-paths, we train the model with dynamic margin loss by a novel dynamic margin function. Extensive evaluations exhibit that TEMP outperforms prior state-of-the-art taxonomy expansion approaches by 14.3% in accuracy and 15.8% in mean reciprocal rank on three public benchmarks.",

            "abstract": "Predicting future link states of a temporal network from past evolution is an important task from application perspective. Different from static networks analysis, temporal link prediction considers the trends of the links as time goes by, which is proved can achieve higher performance than that only exploring the interactions at a specific moment. The key challenge of this task is to obtain effective features of the evolving network. We propose a novel supervised method CTMF based on motif feature, which can characterize nearly complete local topological characteristic of node-pairs in the temporal network. We also attach cluster information as well as temporal transition factor to capture the influence of global structure and network transition on each motif over time. An unsupervised learning strategy is used on a concatenation of the cluster and temporal information based motif features (CTMF) from the continuous sets of snapshots to capture a better feature representation. We validate the effectiveness of the CTMF by utilizing it for link prediction on a number of temporal datasets, which shows our approach outperforms state-of-art methods using other features.",
