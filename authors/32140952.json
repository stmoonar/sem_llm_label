            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose and test three content-based hypotheses that significantly increase message virality. We measure virality as the retweet counts of messages in a pair of real-world Twitter datasets A large dataset - UK Brexit with 51 million tweets from 2.8 million users between June 1, 2015 and May 12, 2019 and a smaller dataset - Nord Stream 2 with 516,000 tweets from 250,000 users between October 1, 2019 and October 15, 2019. We hypothesize, test and conclude that messages incorporating \u201cnegativity bias\u201d, \u201ccausal arguments\u201d and \u201cthreats to personal or societal core values of target audiences\u201d singularly and jointly increase message virality on social media.",

            "abstract": "There is a concerning rise of offensive language on the content generated by the crowd over various social platforms. Such language might bully or hurt the feelings of an individual or a community. Recently, the research community has investigated and developed different supervised approaches and training datasets to detect or prevent offensive monologues or dialogues automatically. In this study, we propose a model for text classification consisting of modular cleaning phase and tokenizer, three embedding methods, and eight classifiers. Our experiments shows a promising result for detection of offensive language on our dataset obtained from Twitter. Considering hyperparameter optimization, three methods of AdaBoost, SVM and MLP had highest average of F1-score on popular embedding method of TF-IDF.",

            "abstract": "Minutia-based palmprint recognition systems has got lots of interest in last two decades. Due to the large number of minutiae in a palmprint, approximately 1000 minutiae, the matching process is time consuming which makes it unpractical for real time applications. One way to address this issue is aligning all palmprint images to a reference image and bringing them to a same coordinate system. Bringing all palmprint images to a same coordinate system, results in fewer computations during minutia matching. In this paper, using convolutional neural network (CNN) and generalized Hough transform (GHT), we propose a new method to register palmprint images accurately. This method, finds the corresponding rotation and displacement (in both x and y direction) between the palmprint and a reference image. Exact palmprint registration can enhance the speed and the accuracy of matching process. Proposed method is capable of distinguishing between left and right palmprint automatically which helps to speed up the matching process. Furthermore, designed structure of CNN in registration stage, gives us the segmented palmprint image from background which is a pre-processing step for minutia extraction. The proposed registration method followed by minutia-cylinder code (MCC) matching algorithm has been evaluated on the THUPALMLAB database, and the results show the superiority of our algorithm over most of the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Using the palmprint in recognition systems has received a lot of interest during the last two decades. Some of these systems are based on first-level features, such as the existing lines and creases in palmprint images, and others use second-level features, such as minutiae, which are more reliable in comparison with the first group. Owing to a large number of minutiae in a palmprint, \u223c1000 minutiae, the matching process is time consuming. In this study, a new minutia-based matching strategy is proposed to make the matching process faster and more efficient. First, an orientation field estimation algorithm based on region-growing is proposed, which emphasises selecting seed points with higher quality. Second, the estimated orientation field is used to align palmprint images to the same coordinate system, resulting in fewer computations during minutia matching. Finally, a new minutia descriptor based on the orientation field is designed to distinguish minutiae with different local orientation structures. This descriptor helps to find two mated minutiae much faster, speeding up the matching process. The proposed palmprint matching algorithm has been evaluated on the THUPALMLAB database, and the results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over most of the state-of-the-art algorithms.",
