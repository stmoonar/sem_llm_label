            "title": "Breaking the Time-Frequency Granularity Discrepancy in Time-Series Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "In light of the remarkable advancements made in time-series anomaly detection(TSAD), recent emphasis has been placed on exploiting the frequency domain as well as the time domain to address the difficulties in precisely detecting pattern-wise anomalies. However, in terms of anomaly scores, the window granularity of the frequency domain is inherently distinct from the data-point granularity of the time domain. Owing to this discrepancy, the anomaly information in the frequency domain has not been utilized to its full potential for TSAD. In this paper, we propose a TSAD framework, Dual-TF, that simultaneously uses both the time and frequency domains while breaking the time-frequency granularity discrepancy. To this end, our framework employs nested-sliding windows, with the outer and inner windows responsible for the time and frequency domains, respectively, and aligns the anomaly scores of the two domains. As a result of the high resolution of the aligned scores, the boundaries of pattern-wise anomalies can be identified more precisely. In six benchmark datasets, our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 12.0--147%, as demonstrated by experimental results.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents an online citizen science game called \u201cGame and Repository for Aperture Solutions and Patterns (GRASP).\u201d GRASP is uniquely tailored to an important task of designing a small-aperture antenna array by leveraging a mathematical structure called the Golomb pattern. In this application of GRASP, an optimal aperture pattern leads to space images of desired spectral resolution observed with the least-cost antenna aperture array via interferometry imaging techniques. Finding near optimal Golomb patterns is computationally very hard. GRASP citizen scientists are tasked with finding (near-)optimal Golomb patterns by selecting cells on a grid that obeys the rules of the game, ensuring Golomb properties to be satisfied. They can also submit known Golomb solutions with their citations, display existing solutions in the GRASP repository, and employ GRASP solutions for non-redundant aperture design of the interferometry and radar applications. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Golomb patterns, and present current design and framework of our citizen science platform GRASP as a means to solve, store, and display such patterns, as well as the motivation behind our work. In particular, we discuss the application of Golomb patterns in astrophysics\u2019 inteferometry missions for small-aperture antenna array design.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents the design and analysis of an automated traffic signage inventory management system employing the radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. Traffic signage inventory management faces the operational challenge of recognizing a large number of traffic signs spread in a large area without obvious identifications on them. Thanks to the remote sensing ability of RFID, the operational efficiency can be significantly improved by scanning traffic signs remotely in motion. The system consists of an in-vehicle RFID reader and a handheld RFID reader, both of which connect to mobile applications with user-friendly interfaces. Additionally, user-friendly control software and a database are developed. In this paper, the adequacy of the RFID technology for the task is assessed. On the theoretical side, this paper investigates the radio-wave propagation model and the antenna radiation range. Additionally, the influences of the vehicle speed and the sign-to-reader distance on the reading performance are studied and empirical tests of the tag positioning are conducted. Finally, a system protocol is validated by a field test.",
