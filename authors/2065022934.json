            "title": "Knowledge-guided analysis of \"omics\" data using the KnowEnG cloud platform",
            "abstract": "We present KnowEnG, a free-to-use computational system for analysis of genomics data sets, designed to accelerate biomedical discovery. It includes tools for popular bioinformatics tasks such as gene prioritization, sample clustering, gene set analysis and expression signature analysis. The system offers \u2018knowledge-guided\u2019 data-mining and machine learning algorithms, where user-provided data are analyzed in light of prior information about genes, aggregated from numerous knowledge-bases and encoded in a massive \u2018Knowledge Network\u2019. KnowEnG adheres to \u2018FAIR\u2019 principles: its tools are easily portable to diverse computing environments, run on the cloud for scalable and cost-effective execution of compute-intensive and data-intensive algorithms, and are interoperable with other computing platforms. They are made available through multiple access modes including a web-portal, and include specialized visualization modules. We present use cases and re-analysis of published cancer data sets using KnowEnG tools and demonstrate its potential value in democratization of advanced tools for the modern genomics era.",

            "title": "EventCube: multi-dimensional search and mining of structured and text data",
            "abstract": "A large portion of real world data is either text or structured (e.g., relational) data. Moreover, such data objects are often linked together (e.g., structured specification of products linking with the corresponding product descriptions and customer comments). Even for text data such as news data, typed entities can be extracted with entity extraction tools. The EventCube project constructs TextCube and TopicCube from interconnected structured and text data (or from text data via entity extraction and dimension building), and performs multidimensional search and analysis on such datasets, in an informative, powerful, and user-friendly manner. This proposed EventCube demo will show the power of the system not only on the originally designed ASRS (Aviation Safety Report System) data sets, but also on news datasets collected from multiple news agencies, and academic datasets constructed from the DBLP and web data. The system has high potential to be extended in many powerful ways and serve as a general platform for search, OLAP (online analytical processing) and data mining on integrated text and structured data. After the system demo in the conference, the system will be put on the web for public access and evaluation.",
