            "abstract": "Recommender System (RS) is ubiquitous on today\u2019s Internet to provide multifaceted personalized information services. While an enormous success has been made in pushing forward high-accuracy recommendations, the other side of the coin \u2014 the recommendation explainability \u2014 needs to be better handled for pursuing persuasiveness, especially for the era of deep learning based recommendation. A few research efforts investigate interpretable recommendation from the feature and result levels. Compared with them, model-level explanation, which unfolds the reasoning process of recommendation through transparent models, still remains underexplored and deserves more attention. In this paper, we propose a model-based explainable recommendation approach, i.e., NS-ICF, which stands for Neuro-Symbolic Interpretable Collaborative Filtering. Thanks to the recent advance on neuro-symbolic computation for automatic rule learning, NS-ICF learns interpretable recommendation rules (consisting of user and item attributes) based on neural networks with two innovations: (1) a three-tower architecture tailored for the user and item sides in the RS domain; (2) fusing the powerful personalized representations of users and items to achieve adaptive rule weights and without sacrificing interpretability. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate NS-ICF is comparable to state-of-the-art deep recommendation models and is transparent for its unique neuro-symbolic architecture.",

            "title": "Scalable Rule-Based Representation Learning for Interpretable Classification",
            "abstract": "Rule-based models, e.g., decision trees, are widely used in scenarios demanding high model interpretability for their transparent inner structures and good model expressivity. However, rule-based models are hard to optimize, especially on large data sets, due to their discrete parameters and structures. Ensemble methods and fuzzy/soft rules are commonly used to improve performance, but they sacrifice the model interpretability. To obtain both good scalability and interpretability, we propose a new classifier, named Rule-based Representation Learner (RRL), that automatically learns interpretable non-fuzzy rules for data representation and classification. To train the non-differentiable RRL effectively, we project it to a continuous space and propose a novel training method, called Gradient Grafting, that can directly optimize the discrete model using gradient descent. An improved design of logical activation functions is also devised to increase the scalability of RRL and enable it to discretize the continuous features end-to-end. Exhaustive experiments on nine small and four large data sets show that RRL outperforms the competitive interpretable approaches and can be easily adjusted to obtain a trade-off between classification accuracy and model complexity for different scenarios.
