            "title": "Recommendation Unlearning via Influence Function",
            "abstract": "Recommendation unlearning is an emerging task to serve users for erasing unusable data (e.g., some historical behaviors) from a well-trained recommender model. Existing methods process unlearning requests by fully or partially retraining the model after removing the unusable data. However, these methods are impractical due to the high computation cost of full retraining and the highly possible performance damage of partial training. In this light, a desired recommendation unlearning method should obtain a similar model as full retraining in a more efficient manner, i.e., achieving complete, efficient and harmless unlearning. In this work, we propose a new Influence Function-based Recommendation Unlearning (IFRU) framework, which efficiently updates the model without retraining by estimating the influence of the unusable data on the model via the influence function. In the light that recent recommender models use historical data for both the constructions of the optimization loss and the computational graph (e.g., neighborhood aggregation), IFRU jointly estimates the direct influence of unusable data on optimization loss and the spillover influence on the computational graph to pursue complete unlearning. Furthermore, we propose an importance-based pruning algorithm to reduce the cost of the influence function. IFRU is harmless and applicable to mainstream differentiable models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IFRU achieves more than 250 times acceleration compared to retraining-based methods with recommendation performance comparable to full retraining.

            "title": "Leveraging Watch-time Feedback for Short-Video Recommendations: A Causal Labeling Framework",
            "abstract": "With the proliferation of short video applications, the significance of short video recommendations has vastly increased. Unlike other recommendation scenarios, short video recommendation systems heavily rely on feedback from watch time. Existing approaches simply treat watch time as a direct label, failing to effectively harness its extensive semantics and introduce bias, thereby limiting the potential for modeling user interests based on watch time. To overcome this challenge, we propose a framework named Debiased Multiple-semantics-extracting Labeling (DML). DML constructs labels that encompass various semantics by utilizing quantiles derived from the distribution of watch time, prioritizing relative order rather than absolute label values. This approach facilitates easier model learning while aligning with the ranking objective of recommendations. Furthermore, we introduce a method inspired by causal adjustment to refine label definitions, thereby directly mitigating bias at the label level. We substantiate the effectiveness of our DML framework through both online and offline experiments. Extensive results demonstrate that our DML could effectively leverage watch time to discover users' real interests, enhancing their engagement in our application.",

            "abstract": "In order to improve the system capacity of distributed antenna system (DAS) in downlink high-speed train (HST) environments, this paper presents a power allocation scheme for remote antenna units (RAUs) based on the cooperative distributed antenna system (CDAS). The investigated power allocation scheme exploits the channel state information (CSI) between RAUs and vehicle-mounted relay (VMR). Based on the CDAS-CSI power allocation, a corresponding RAU selection algorithm is introduced to quickly find the suboptimal solution that maximizes the channel capacity and to optimize the number of RAUs in CDAS. Simulation results show that the CDAS-CSI power allocation greatly improves the downlink system capacity compared to the cases of non-cooperation among RAUs and equal power allocation among RAUs.",

            "abstract": "In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, Newton iteration can effectively reduce the computation complexity of regularized zero forcing (RZF) precoding algorithm in which complicated matrix inversion is required. However, the Newton iteration has slow convergence speed and it needs complicated calculation to search initial values. In this paper, by using successive over-relaxation (SOR) iteration, a matrix inversion method, namely successive over-relaxation matrix inverse (SORMI) iteration, is derived to obtain the initial values for Newton iteration. Correspondingly, the SORMI-Newton joint precoding algorithm is presented. Moreover, convergence and complexity are analyzed for the investigated joint precoding algorithm. Simulation results show that compared with the conventional Newton, the joint precoding algorithm possesses have faster convergence speed because of its appropriate initial values, at the same time, it can achieve a bit error rate (BER) performance comparable to that of the RZF.",
