            "title": "A Preliminary Study of ChatGPT on News Recommendation: Personalization, Provider Fairness, Fake News",
            "abstract": "Online news platforms commonly employ personalized news recommendation methods to assist users in discovering interesting articles, and many previous works have utilized language model techniques to capture user interests and understand news content. With the emergence of large language models like GPT-3 and T-5, a new recommendation paradigm has emerged, leveraging pre-trained language models for making recommendations. ChatGPT, with its user-friendly interface and growing popularity, has become a prominent choice for text-based tasks. Considering the growing reliance on ChatGPT for language tasks, the importance of news recommendation in addressing social issues, and the trend of using language models in recommendations, this study conducts an initial investigation of ChatGPT's performance in news recommendations, focusing on three perspectives: personalized news recommendation, news provider fairness, and fake news detection. ChatGPT has the limitation that its output is sensitive to the input phrasing. We therefore aim to explore the constraints present in the generated responses of ChatGPT for each perspective. Additionally, we investigate whether specific prompt formats can alleviate these constraints or if these limitations require further attention from researchers in the future. We also surpass fixed evaluations by developing a webpage to monitor ChatGPT's performance on weekly basis on the tasks and prompts we investigated. Our aim is to contribute to and encourage more researchers to engage in the study of enhancing news recommendation performance through the utilization of large language models such as ChatGPT.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the feasibility of developing an Artificial General Recommender (AGR), facilitated by recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs). An AGR comprises both conversationality and universality to engage in natural dialogues and generate recommendations across various domains. We propose ten fundamental principles that an AGR should adhere to, each with its corresponding testing protocols. We proceed to assess whether ChatGPT, a sophisticated LLM, can comply with the proposed principles by engaging in recommendation-oriented dialogues with the model while observing its behavior. Our findings demonstrate the potential for ChatGPT to serve as an AGR, though several limitations and areas for improvement are identified.",

            "title": "PBNR: Prompt-based News Recommender System",
            "abstract": "Online news platforms often use personalized news recommendation methods to help users discover articles that align with their interests. These methods typically predict a matching score between a user and a candidate article to reflect the user's preference for the article. Some previous works have used language model techniques, such as the attention mechanism, to capture users' interests based on their past behaviors, and to understand the content of articles. However, these existing model architectures require adjustments if additional information is taken into account. Pre-trained large language models, which can better capture word relationships and comprehend contexts, have seen a significant development in recent years, and these pre-trained models have the advantages of transfer learning and reducing the training time for downstream tasks. Meanwhile, prompt learning is a newly developed technique that leverages pre-trained language models by building task-specific guidance for output generations. To leverage textual information in news articles, this paper introduces the pre-trained large language model and prompt-learning to the community of news recommendation. The proposed model\"prompt-based news recommendation\"(PBNR) treats the personalized news recommendation as a text-to-text language task and designs personalized prompts to adapt to the pre-trained language model -- text-to-text transfer transformer (T5). Experimental studies using the Microsoft News dataset show that PBNR is capable of making accurate recommendations by taking into account various lengths of past behaviors of different users. PBNR can also easily adapt to new information without changing the model architecture and the training objective. Additionally, PBNR can make recommendations based on users' specific requirements, allowing human-computer interaction in the news recommendation field.",

            "abstract": "In recommender systems, reinforcement learning solutions have effectively boosted recommendation performance because of their ability to capture long-term user-system interaction. However, the action space of the recommendation policy is a list of items, which could be extremely large with a dynamic candidate item pool. To overcome this challenge, we propose a hyper-actor and critic learning framework where the policy decomposes the item list generation process into a hyper-action inference step and an effect-action selection step. The first step maps the given state space into a vectorized hyper-action space, and the second step selects the item list based on the hyper-action. In order to regulate the discrepancy between the two action spaces, we design an alignment module along with a kernel mapping function for items to ensure inference accuracy and include a supervision module to stabilize the learning process. We build simulated environments on public datasets and empirically show that our framework is superior in recommendation compared to standard RL baselines.",

            "abstract": "Foundation Models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced many research areas. In particular, LLMs offer significant advantages for recommender systems, making them valuable tools for personalized recommendations. For example, by formulating various recommendation tasks such as rating prediction, sequential recommendation, straightforward recommendation, and explanation generation into language instructions, LLMs make it possible to build universal recommendation engines that can handle different recommendation tasks. Additionally, LLMs have a remarkable capacity for understanding natural language, enabling them to comprehend user preferences, item descriptions, and contextual information to generate more accurate and relevant recommendations, leading to improved user satisfaction and engagement. This tutorial introduces Foundation Models such as LLMs for recommendation. We will introduce how recommender system advanced from shallow models to deep models and to large models, how LLMs enable generative recommendation in contrast to traditional discriminative recommendation, and how to build LLM-based recommender systems. We will cover multiple perspectives of LLM-based recommendation, including data preparation, model design, model pre-training, fine-tuning and prompting, multi-modality and multi-task learning, as well as trustworthy perspectives of LLM-based recommender systems such as fairness and transparency.",

            "abstract": "Epilepsy is one kind of neurological disease characterized by recurring seizures. Recurrent seizures can cause ongoing negative mental and cognitive damage to the patient. Therefore, timely diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy are crucial for patients. Manual electroencephalography (EEG) signals analysis is time and energy consuming, making automatic detection using EEG signals particularly important. Many deep learning algorithms have thus been proposed to detect seizures. These methods rely on expensive and bulky hardware, which makes them unsuitable for deployment on devices with limited resources due to their high demands on computer resources. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight neural network for seizure detection using pure convolutions, which is composed of inverted residual structure and multi-scale channel attention mechanism. Compared with other methods, our approach significantly reduces the computational complexity, making it possible to deploy on low-cost portable devices for seizures detection. We conduct experiments on the CHB-MIT dataset and achieves 98.7% accuracy, 98.3% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity with 2.68[Formula: see text]M multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) and only 88[Formula: see text]K parameters.",

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLM) not only have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) but also have the potential to reshape many other fields, e.g., recommender systems (RS). However, most of the related work treats an LLM as a component of the conventional recommendation pipeline (e.g., as a feature extractor), which may not be able to fully leverage the generative power of LLM. Instead of separating the recommendation process into multiple stages, such as score computation and re-ranking, this process can be simplified to one stage with LLM: directly generating recommendations from the complete pool of items. This survey reviews the progress, methods, and future directions of LLM-based generative recommendation by examining three questions: 1) What generative recommendation is, 2) Why RS should advance to generative recommendation, and 3) How to implement LLM-based generative recommendation for various RS tasks. We hope that this survey can provide the context and guidance needed to explore this interesting and emerging topic.",

            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from the industry and academic communities. While previous models have achieved remarkable successes, an important problem may still hinder their performances, that is, the sparsity of the real-world data. In this paper, we propose a novel counterfactual data augmentation framework to alleviate the problem of data sparsity. In specific, our framework contains a sampler model and an anchor model. The sampler model aims to generate high-quality user behavior sequences, while the anchor model is trained based on the original and new generated samples, and leveraged to provide the final recommendation list. To implement the sampler model, we first design four types of heuristic methods based on either random or frequency-based strategies. And then, to improve the quality of the generated sequences, we propose two learning-based samplers by discovering the decision boundaries or increasing the sample informativeness. At last, we build an RL based model to automatically determine where to edit the history behaviors and how many items should be replaced. Considering that the sampler model can be imperfect, we, at last, analyze the influence of the noisy information contained in the generated sequences on the anchor model in theory, and design a simple but effective method to better serve the anchor model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",

            "title": "Hybrid Attention Network for Epileptic EEG Classification",
            "abstract": "Automatic seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) based on deep learning has been significantly improved. However, existing works have not adequately excavate the spatial-temporal information between EEG channels. Besides, most works mainly focus on patient-specific scenarios while cross-patient seizure detection is more challenging and meaningful. Regarding the above problems, we propose a hybrid attention network (HAN) for automatic seizure detection. Specifically, the graph attention network (GAT) extracts spatial features at the front end, and Transformer gets time features as the back end. HAN leverages the attention mechanism and fully extracts the spatial-temporal correlation of EEG signals. The focal loss function is introduced to HAN to deal with the imbalance of the dataset accompanied by seizure detection based on EEG. Both patient-specific and patient-independent experiments are carried out on the public CHB-MIT database. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of HAN in both experimental settings.",
