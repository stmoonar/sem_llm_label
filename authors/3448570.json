            "abstract": "In the last years a rapid emergence of lexical resources has evolved in the Semantic Web. Whereas most of the linguistic information is already machine-readable, we found that morphological information is mostly absent or only contained in semi-structured strings. An integration of morphemic data has not yet been undertaken due to the lack of existing domain-specific ontologies and explicit morphemic data. In this paper, we present the Multilingual Morpheme Ontology called MMoOn Core which can be regarded as the first comprehensive ontology for the linguistic domain of morphological language data. It will be described how crucial concepts like morphs, morphemes, word forms and meanings are represented and interrelated and how language-specific morpheme inventories can be created as a new possibility of morphological datasets. The aim of the MMoOn Core ontology is to serve as a shared semantic model for linguists and NLP researchers alike to enable the creation, conversion, exchange, reuse and enrichment of morphological language data across different data-dependent language sciences. Therefore, various use cases are illustrated to draw attention to the cross-disciplinary potential which can be realized with the MMoOn Core ontology in the context of the existing Linguistic Linked Data research landscape.",

            "abstract": "Despite a large number of active speakers, most Bantu languages can be considered as underor lessresourced languages. This includes especially the current situation of lexicographical data, which is highly unsatisfactory concerning the size, quality and consistency in format and provided information. Unfortunately, this does not only hold for the amount and quality of data for monolingual dictionaries, but also for their lack of interconnection to form a network of dictionaries. Current endeavours to promote the use of Bantu languages in primary and secondary education in countries like South Africa show the urgent need for high-quality digital dictionaries. This contribution describes a prototypical implementation for aligning Xhosa, Zimbabwean Ndebele and Kalanga language dictionaries based on their English translations using simple string matching techniques and via WordNet URIs. The RDF-based representation of the data using the Bantu Language Model (BLM) and \u2013 partial \u2013 references to the established WordNet dataset supported this process significantly. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Information systems \u2192 Resource Description Framework (RDF); Computing methodologies \u2192 Phonology / morphology; Information systems \u2192 Dictionaries",

            "abstract": "Recent years have experienced a growing trend in the publication of language resources as Linguistic Linked Data (LLD) to enhance their discovery, reuse and the interoperability of tools that consume language data. To this aim, the OntoLex-lemon model has emerged as a de facto standard to represent lexical data on the Web. However, traditional dictionaries contain a considerable amount of morphological information which is not straightforwardly representable as LLD within the current model. In order to fill this gap a new Morphology Module of OntoLex-lemon is currently being developed. This paper presents the results of this model as on-going work as well as the underlying challenges that emerged during the module development. Based on the MMoOn Core ontology, it aims to account for a wide range of morphological information, ranging from endings to derive whole paradigms to the decomposition and generation of lexical entries which is in compliance to other OntoLex-lemon modules and facilitates the encoding of complex morphological data in ontology lexicons.",

In this paper we measure what contribution a structural analysis of the query and the datasets can bring to a recommendation strategy, to go alongside approaches that provide a semantic analysis. Here we concentrate on the case of star-shaped SPARQL queries over RDF datasets. The illustrated strategy performs a least general generalization on the given query, computes the specializations of it that are satisfiable by the target dataset, and organizes them into a graph. It then visits the graph to recommend first the reformulated queries that reflect the original query as closely as possible. This approach does not rely upon a semantic mapping between the two datasets. An implementation as part of the SQUIRE query recommendation library is discussed. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Information systems \u2192 Semantic web description languages",

            "abstract": "Forty years ago the linguist Dr. Christian Lehmann developed a framework for documenting linguistic terms, concepts and bibliographic data that resulted in the LiDo Terminological and Bibliographical Database (LiDo TBD). Since 2006 students and linguistic researchers bene\ufb01t from the data by looking it up on the Web. Even though, the LiDo TBD is implemented as a relational database, its underlying framework aims at yielding a terminological network containing data nodes that are connected via speci\ufb01c relation edges in order to create an interrelated data graph. Now, with the emergence of Semantic Web technologies we were able to implement this pioneering work by converting the LiDo TBD relational database into a Linked Data graph. In this paper we present and describe the creation of the LiDo RDF dataset and introduce the LiDo RDF project. The goals of this project are to enable the direct use and reuse of the data both for the scienti\ufb01c research community and machine processing alike as well as to enable a valuable enrichment of already existing linguistic terminological and bibliographic data by including LiDo RDF in the LLOD cloud.",

In this paper we present a new source of lexicographical data for Xhosa, a language spoken by more than eight million speakers. For its utilisation in a multilingual and federated environment it is modelled using a dedicated OWL ontology for Bantu languages and possesses all features that are currently considered integral for the promotion of resource reuse as well as long-term usage. In the future, the introduced ontology may be used for other Bantu languages as well and may ease their combination to achieve more extensive, multilingual data stocks.",

It deals in particular with the ontolex and decomp modules and their potential as ontological foundation to represent the domain of morphological language data (MLD). It will be argued that ontolex and decomp provide only a basic modelling of the domain, which is not su\ufb03cient for representing \ufb01ne-grained MLD, but suitable for interconnecting OntoLex with the Multilingual Morpheme Core Ontology (MMoOn Core). Both models each o\ufb00er a modelling of a linguistic domain - OntoLex for lexical language data and MMoOn Core for morphological language data - that exhibits a notable amount of conceptual overlap. Thus, this paper investigates the potential of exploiting the overlap of both models for initiating an ontology-based interconnection of lexical and morphological datasets.",

However, equivalent models covering the linguistic domain of morphology do not exist. As a result, there are hardly any language resources of morphemic data available in RDF to date. This paper presents the creation of the Hebrew Morpheme Inventory from a manually compiled tabular dataset comprising around 52.000 entries. It is an ongoing effort of representing the lexemes, word-forms and morphologigal patterns together with their underlying relations based on the newly created Multilingual Morpheme Ontology (MMoOn). It will be shown how segmented Hebrew language data can be granularly described in a Linked Data format, thus, serving as an exemplary case for creating morpheme inventories of any inflectional language with MMoOn. The resulting dataset is described a) according to the structure of the underlying data format, b) with respect to the Hebrew language characteristic of building word-forms directly from roots, c) by exemplifying how inflectional information is realized and d) with regard to its enrichment with external links to sense resources.",

            "abstract": "The Open Linguistics Working Group (OWLG) brings together researchers from various fields of linguistics, natural language processing, and information technology to present and discuss principles, case studies, and best practices for representing, publishing and linking linguistic data collections. A major outcome of our work is the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud, an LOD (sub-)cloud of linguistic resources, which covers various linguistic databases, lexicons, corpora, terminologies, and metadata repositories. We present and summarize five years of progress on the development of the cloud and of advancements in open data in linguistics, and we describe recent community activities. The paper aims to serve as a guideline to orient and involve researchers with the community and/or Linguistic Linked Open Data.",
