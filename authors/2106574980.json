            "abstract": "Abstract The rapid development of technology allows people to obtain a large amount of data, which contains important information and various noises. How to obtain useful knowledge from data is the most important thing at this stage of machine learning (ML). The problem of unbalanced classification is currently an important topic in the field of data mining and ML. At present, this problem has attracted more and more attention and is a relatively new challenge for academia and industry. The problem of unbalanced classification involves classifying data when there is insufficient data or severe category distribution deviations. Due to the inherent complexity of unbalanced data sets, more new algorithms and tools are needed to effectively convert a large amount of raw data into useful information and knowledge. Unbalanced data set is a special case of classification problem, in which the distribution between classes is uneven, and it is difficult to classify data accurately. This article mainly introduces the research on the processing method of computer algorithms based on the processing method of unbalanced data sets based on ML, aiming to provide some ideas and directions for the processing of computer algorithms based on unbalanced data sets based on ML. This article proposes a research strategy for processing unbalanced data sets based on ML, including data preprocessing, decision tree data classification algorithm, and C4.5 algorithm, which are used to conduct research experiments on processing methods for unbalanced data sets based on ML. The experimental results in this article show that the accuracy rate of the decision tree C4.5 algorithm based on ML is 94.80%, which can be better used for processing unbalanced data sets based on ML.",

            "abstract": "In the urgent need of large-scale research, the use of high-performance computer processing technology for performance information management has become a popular trend. This paper aims to evaluate the current situation of performance management and put forward further research direction. The expected improvements in performance, accountability, transparency, service quality and cost-effectiveness of performance information management have not yet been achieved. There are three problems in performance management: technical problems, institutional problems and participation problems. In order to build a comprehensive performance management system, external imposed restructuring and restructuring limit the successful implementation of performance management. This paper introduces the architecture and prototype implementation of a web service performance management system based on cluster. The system supports multiple types of web service traffic, dynamically allocates server resources, and maximizes the expected value of a given cluster utility function in the case of load fluctuations. The cluster utility is a performance function that provides each class with different services. The results show that the weight of performance appraisal index is the highest, accounting for 31%.",

            "abstract": "For the problem of Panchromatic and multispectral remote sensing image fusion, we propose a remote sensing image fusion algorithm based on nonnegative dictionary learning. The basic idea of the algorithm is to use the panchromatic image with high spatial resolution to learn the high-low resolution dictionary pair, and to improve the fusion effect of remote sensing image by combining the nonnegativity of the image. Firstly, high resolution dictionary and low resolution dictionary are learned from high spatial resolution panchromatic image by nonnegative dictionary learning technology. Then multispectral image is sparsely represented by low resolution dictionary to obtain coefficient matrix. Finally, using coefficient matrix and high resolution dictionary, high resolution multispectral image is reconstructed. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed algorithm can get high spatial resolution and well preserve spectral information of multispectral image. Our experimental results of real QUICKBIRD and IKONOS remote sensing image fusion validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

            "abstract": "The Internet of Things is the most heated topic in the current electronic information technology industry. It is generally believed that it will become a new driving force for the development of human industry, and its comprehensive application will promote the human society to step forward to the \u201csmart earth\u201d. In this paper, based on artificial intelligence and Internet of Things technology, experimental design of fuzzy control and PID control algorithm anti-interference performance test simulation box. Experimental data show that due to the Internet of Things control system in the process of application, the controlled object in different degrees of non-linear, large lag, parameter time-varying and model uncertainty characteristics. It can be seen from the principle and simulation results that fuzzy control does not require the precise model of the controlled object and has strong adaptability. The experimental results show that if the pulses with a height of 0.1, a period of 10s, a width of 2S and a delay of 4s are set, interference is added to the output of a sampling time controller. Among them, $\\mathrm{T}1=2, \\mathrm{T}2=1,\\, =0.5$, then the initial PID $\\text{Kp}0=7.6,\\ \\text{Ki}0=1.12,\\ \\text{Kd}0=4.88$ in the fuzzy PID control system. The Internet of Things control system server has the advantages of comprehensive functions, good expansibility, easy operation and maintenance, etc., and the adoption of automated testing technology improves the efficiency and standardization of the server design process.",

            "abstract": "The data placement strategy is an important issue in the scientific workflows which is devoted to reducing the data movements while placing datasets in a few data centers according to the data centers\u2019 storage capacity and the data dependency. The data placement is proved to be a NP hard problem, and several methods for this problem like K-means clustering algorithm are presented in the literatures. K-means clustering algorithm can reduce the number of data movements very well, but it may result that the datasets will be concentrated to few data centers, and so the loads of data centers greatly deviate from each other. The paper proposes a data placement strategy based on heuristic genetic algorithm to reduce data movements among the data centers while balancing the loads of data centers. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce data movements and balance the load of data centers.
