            "abstract": "We present KnowEnG, a free-to-use computational system for analysis of genomics data sets, designed to accelerate biomedical discovery. It includes tools for popular bioinformatics tasks such as gene prioritization, sample clustering, gene set analysis and expression signature analysis. The system offers \u2018knowledge-guided\u2019 data-mining and machine learning algorithms, where user-provided data are analyzed in light of prior information about genes, aggregated from numerous knowledge-bases and encoded in a massive \u2018Knowledge Network\u2019. KnowEnG adheres to \u2018FAIR\u2019 principles: its tools are easily portable to diverse computing environments, run on the cloud for scalable and cost-effective execution of compute-intensive and data-intensive algorithms, and are interoperable with other computing platforms. They are made available through multiple access modes including a web-portal, and include specialized visualization modules. We present use cases and re-analysis of published cancer data sets using KnowEnG tools and demonstrate its potential value in democratization of advanced tools for the modern genomics era.",

            "abstract": "Background Clustering is one of the most common techniques in data analysis and seeks to group together data points that are similar in some measure. Although there are many computer programs available for performing clustering, a single web resource that provides several state-of-the-art clustering methods, interactive visualizations and evaluation of clustering results is lacking. Methods ClusterEnG (acronym for Clustering Engine for Genomics) provides a web interface for clustering data and interactive visualizations including 3D views, data selection and zoom features. Eighteen clustering validation measures are also presented to aid the user in selecting a suitable algorithm for their dataset. ClusterEnG also aims at educating the user about the similarities and differences between various clustering algorithms and provides tutorials that demonstrate potential pitfalls of each algorithm. Conclusions The web resource will be particularly useful to scientists who are not conversant with computing but want to understand the structure of their data in an intuitive manner. The validation measures facilitate the process of choosing a suitable clustering algorithm among the available options.
