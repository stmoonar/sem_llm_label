            "abstract": "In heterogeneous SDN networks, controllers deploying different protocols need to cooperate with each other and establish a global network view that can be passed to the network applications for unified management and end-to-end decision-making. Unfortunately, there is no standard northbound interface protocol to integrate heterogeneous SDN controllers. To address this issue in this paper, we propose an approach to find the mapping among controller ontologies in the SDN network with heterogeneous controllers in this paper. We regard these controller ontologies as a solution for discovering similar elements between local ontologies and global ontology. By mapping controller ontologies in the heterogeneous network together, we can form the complete network view to achieve centralized management. The idea behind the approach is to use ontology to represent the conceptual data of various heterogeneous controllers and then map similar semantic data together to form a consistent, global network knowledge. Evaluation results show that our approach has better accuracy than other algorithms and has an acceptable execution time.",

Consequently, controllers have to be carefully deployed based on dynamical topology and time-varying workload. However, existing work on controller placement and assignment is not applicable to LEO satellite networks with highly dynamic topology and randomly fluctuating load. In this paper, we first formulate the adaptive controller placement and assignment (ACPA) problem and prove its NP-hardness. Then, we propose the control relation graph (CRG) to quantitatively capture the control overhead in LEO satellite networks. Next, we propose the CRG-based controller placement and assignment (CCPA) algorithm with a bounded approximation ratio. Finally, using the predicted topology and estimated traffic load, a lookahead-based improvement algorithm is designed to further decrease the overall management costs. Extensive emulation results demonstrate that the CCPA algorithm outperforms related schemes in terms of response time and load balancing.",

            "abstract": "SDN (Software defined networking) provides effective technical methods for optimal resource management. However, there are resource conflicts frequent and serious in current related schemes because they mix elephant and mice flows on shared transmission paths. So, controllers in SDN have to be smart enough to detect elephant flows with low cost and then reroute elephant and mice flows in a feature-aware way. However, existing elephant flow detection schemes suffer from high bandwidth consumption and long detection time; and little literature considers mice-flow scheduling. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Sampling and Classification Approach (ESCA). Our ESCA significantly reduces sampling overhead through estimating the arrival interval of elephant flows and filtering out redundant samples, and efficiently classifies samples with a new supervised classification algorithm based on correlations among data flows. Then, based on our low-cost ESCA, we propose a novel load-balanced routing approach LBRouting that sets up paths for elephant and mice flows with different mechanisms. The theoretical analysis proofs our ESCA outperforms related schemes. Extensive experiment results further demonstrate that our ESCA can provide accurate detection with less sampled packets and shorter detection time; and our routing approach LBRouting significantly outperforms related proposals.",

            "abstract": "As crowdsourcing has cast a new solution to numerous tasks, truth inference, which deduces the accurate answer from massive noise labels (answers), has become quite an essential issue. However, existing proposals of truth inference only excel at limited tasks since they excessively depend on modeling either workers or labels with simple assumptions. In this paper, we propose BAT (Bipartite Attention-driven Truth) to flexibly infer the truth in various scenarios. The key behind BAT is to explore a comprehensive approach from the whole topology of crowdsourcing itself rather than any individual component. Specifically, BAT firstly characterizes the crowdsourcing as an attributed bipartite graph (ABG). Then it deploys a bipartite graph neural network (bi-GNN). The bi-GNN relies on a bipartite attention mechanism for exploiting the importance of different answers to compute the correct one. For verifying BAT, we compare BAT with other eight existing truth inference methods on real-world datasets from different domains (image, text, audio). The results show that BAT performs best on different crowdsourcing tasks.",

            "title": "Neighborhood Matters: Influence Maximization in Social Networks With Limited Access",
            "abstract": "Influence maximization (IM) aims at maximizing the spread of influence by offering discounts to influential users (called seeding). In many applications, due to user\u2019s privacy concern, overwhelming network scale etc., it is hard to target any user in the network as one wishes. Instead, only a small subset of users is initially accessible. Such access limitation would significantly impair the influence spread, since IM often relies on seeding high degree users, which are particularly rare in such a small subset due to the power-law structure of social networks. In this paper, we attempt to solve the limited IM in real-world scenarios by the adaptive approach with seeding and diffusion uncertainty considered. Specifically, we consider fine-grained discounts and assume users accept the discount probabilistically. The diffusion process is depicted by the independent cascade model. To overcome the access limitation, we prove the set-wise friendship paradox (FP) phenomenon that neighbors have higher degree in expectation, and propose a two-stage seeding model with the FP embedded, where neighbors are seeded. On this basis, for comparison we formulate the non-adaptive case and adaptive case, both proven to be NP-hard. In the non-adaptive case, discounts are allocated to users all at once. We show the monotonicity of influence spread w.r.t. discount allocation and design a two-stage coordinate descent framework to decide the discount allocation. In the adaptive case, users are sequentially seeded based on observations of existing seeding and diffusion results. We prove the adaptive submodularity and submodularity of the influence spread function in two stages. Then, a series of adaptive greedy algorithms are proposed with constant approximation ratio. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our adaptive algorithms achieve larger influence spread than non-adaptive and other adaptive algorithms (up to a maximum of 116 percent).",

The key techniques in spatial crowdsourcing include worker-mobitlity-based task matching for more information gain and efficient cooperation among coworkers. In this paper, we first propose information gain based maximum task matching problem, where each spatial task needs to be performed before its expiration time and workers are moving dynamically. We then prove it is a NP-hard problem. Next, we propose two approximation algorithms: greedy and extremum algorithms. In order to improve the time efficiency and the task assignment accuracy, we further propose an optimization approach. Subsequently, for complex spatial tasks, we propose a feedback-based cooperation mechanism, model the worker affinity and the matching degree between a task and a group of coworkers, and design a feedback-based assignment algorithm with group affinity.

            "abstract": "The state-of-the-art machine teaching techniques overestimate the ability of learners in grasping a complex concept. On one side, since a complicated concept always contains multiple fine-grained concepts, students can only grasp parts of them during a practical teaching process. On the other side, because a single teaching sample contains unequal information in terms of various fine-grained concepts, learners accept them at different levels. Thus, with more and more complicated dataset, it is challenging for us to rethink the machine teaching frameworks. In this work, we propose a new machine teaching framework called Attentive Machine Teaching (AMT). Specifically, we argue that a complicated concept always consists of multiple features, which we call fine-grained concepts. We define attention to represent the learning level of a learner in studying a fine-grained concept. Afterwards, we propose AMT, an adaptive teaching framework to construct the personalized optimal teaching dataset for learners. During each iteration, we estimate the workers' ability with Graph Neural Network (GNN) and select the best sample using a pool-based searching approach. For corroborating our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments with both synthetic datasets and real datasets. Our experimental results verify the effectiveness of AMT algorithms.",
