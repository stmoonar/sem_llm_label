            "title": "Short-term forecast of EV charging stations occupancy probability using big data streaming analysis",
            "abstract": "The widespread diffusion of electric mobility requires a contextual expansion of the charging infrastructure. An extended collection and processing of information regarding charging of electric vehicles may turn each electric vehicle charging station into a valuable source of streaming data. Charging point operators may profit from all these data for optimizing their operation and planning activities. In such a scenario, big data and machine learning techniques would allow valorizing real-time data coming from electric vehicle charging stations. This paper presents an architecture able to deal with data streams from a charging infrastructure, with the final aim to forecast electric charging station availability after a set amount of minutes from present time. Both batch data regarding past charges and real-time data streams are used to train a streaming logistic regression model, to take into account recurrent past situations and unexpected actual events. The streaming model performs better than a model trained only using historical data. The results highlight the importance of constantly updating the predictive model parameters in order to adapt to changing conditions and always provide accurate forecasts.",

            "abstract": "Recent innovations in Information Technology, Cloud Computing, Big Data analysis, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are enabling technological solutions that were previously unimaginable, or usually available only for big IT companies, with impacts in both industry and services. The demonstrator named Smart Grid Semantic Platform (SGSP) has been created using these technologies integrating several aspects of the management of an electricity distribution network. The services deployed on the platform concern the visualization of the topographic data and electricity grid assets, as well as the processing and displaying of historical data related to the operation of the networks and/or the result of Big Data analysis. This paper demonstrates how useful the synergy is between the standard semantic model of the electric network (IEC CIM 61968) and the historical data of the time series of medium voltage electricity consumption analyzed using a Big Data platform. Specifically it illustrates the realization of a use case about the calculation of a load index of the electric lines.",

            "abstract": "In recent years Italian power sector has been undergoing considerable changes: EU Directive on electricity (96/92/EC) established common rules for the creation of internal markets and required privatization of Italy's dominant energy monopolies, but also extended to all domestic customers the possibility to choose their own energy retailers starting from July 2007. This will involve a new role for the final user who will change from passive consumer to active participant. To get the most advantage from this opportunity it is necessary to provide a platform which will be interoperable with home and building automation systems and that will supply several functionalities as communicate with distributor/retailer, interact with consumer, manage loads, energy storages and domestic micro-generation. In this way households will become active \"nodes\" of the electric network that could also provide services for the network (power modulation) and the market (reduce energy price volatility).",

            "abstract": "In a liberalized and fragmented market, with many operators involved, ancillary services are provided by several actors. Distribution utilities take part in the reduction of the vulnerability of the electrical system in agreement with guidelines and rules stated by independent system operators. In Italy, most of emergency defence systems are implemented on HV/MV distribution sub-stations and on MV grids. After the 2003 Italian blackout many projects have been undertaken to improve emergency plans both in medium and long term perspective. In the short term, the collaboration among the Italian ISO and distribution companies brought to experiment new equipment and strategies in distribution networks. In the long term, research is focusing also in the exploitation of the use of Electronic Meters to manage peak demand. Even if demand side management (DSM) cannot be properly considered an emergency plan for the security of an electric systems, it could contribute to stabilize it, assuring a sufficient generation margin, through a better use of energy. DSM through AMR can benefit from statistical models for load profile fitting and forecasting. Using a combination of regression and times series models, it is possible to obtain accurate short-term predictions of the load at any load point. Schemes and layouts of local automation systems are presented. Limits are considered.",

            "abstract": "To observe a real complex phenomenon, many pieces of information with different levels ofaccuracy and reliability provided by sensors or human experts are often available. Thus, the fusion of all these pieces of information is a great challenge in order to pro- vide a synthetic description of the studied phenomenon. Currently, a lot of computational intelligence fusion methods and processes exist, but often the considered information fusion systems are ad hoc ones. Thus, there is a need to have formal comparison elements between the fusion methods used. In this view, this paper presents a study of the equivalence between two well known fuzzy fusion approaches: the fuzzy Choquet integrals and the fuzzy linguistic rules. An exact input- output equivalence is obtained if a set of rules is associated to each ranking of input data (that defines a simplex). If only a unique set of rules is considered for the whole input space, the equivalence is then partial but the output difference between the two approaches is bounded. The presented ideas are illustrated on the problem of ani- mated film evaluation by experts.",
