            "abstract": "The National Science Foundation\u2019s Arctic Data Center is the primary data repository for NSF-funded research conducted in the Arctic. There are major challenges in discovering and interpreting resources in a repository containing data as heterogeneous and interdisciplinary as those in the Arctic Data Center. This paper reports on advances in cyberinfrastructure at the Arctic Data Center that help address these issues by leveraging semantic technologies that enhance the repository\u2019s adherence to the FAIR data principles and improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability of digital resources in the repository. We describe the Arctic Data Center\u2019s improvements. We use semantic annotation to bind metadata about Arctic data sets with concepts in web-accessible ontologies. The Arctic Data Center\u2019s implementation of a semantic annotation mechanism is accompanied by the development of an extended search interface that increases the findability of data by allowing users to search for specific, broader, and narrower meanings of measurement descriptions, as well as through their potential synonyms. Based on research carried out by the DataONE project, we evaluated the potential impact of this approach, regarding the accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of measurement data. Arctic research often benefits from having additional data, typically from multiple, heterogeneous sources, that complement and extend the bases \u2013 spatially, temporally, or thematically \u2013 for understanding Arctic phenomena. These relevant data resources must be \u2018found\u2019",

            "abstract": "Disaster risk properties (or disaster variables) such as intensity, exposure, severity, vulnerability, resilience, and capacity are significant because they provide essential information for understanding and managing disaster risk and cascading effects. While there are an increasing number of datasets that record these properties based on different criteria, such as regional levels (e.g., community resilience at counties vs. census tracts), thematic levels (e.g., social vulnerability based on race vs. socioeconomic status), or even for different hazard types (e.g., disaster risk for earthquakes vs. hurricanes), we lack a formal model that captures the semantics of these properties, i.e., their interactions with one another, and their context. Context is described through relations that constrain each property specific to an entity or as a property of an entity with respect to another entity. For example, intensity is exclusively the property of a disaster event, whereas vulnerability is a property of an element-at-risk concerning a specific hazard type. Here, we propose the Disaster Properties Ontology (DPO) that formalizes seven core properties in the disaster domain. It is built by re-using existing standard ontologies such as OWL-Time, GeoSPARQL, SOSA, and PROV-O. Additionally, DPO is developed as a sub-module of a more comprehensive Disaster Management reference Domain Ontology (DMDO).",

            "abstract": "It is crucial for emergency management organizations to have rapid access to relevant experts who can advise and assist following a disaster. To improve expert-mining and recommendation capabilities, creating a knowledge graph that links experts to their corresponding topics of expertise and other sources of relevant information is a natural choice to capture an integrated network of people and a rich taxonomy of expertise. In this paper, we present an ontology for modeling experts, their expertise topics and relations between them, and their spatiotemporal scoping. We go on to discuss the primary conceptual components and how they can be instantiated, then present overarching examples related to emergency management operations. The ontology synthesizes three different ways to characterize an expert, based on a) identifiable academic expertise; b) voluntary engagements, work-related responsibilities or experience; and c) organization specializations or affiliations.",

            "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed an increasing frequency and intensity of disasters, from extreme weather, drought, and wildfires to hurricanes, floods, and wars. Providing timely disaster response and humanitarian aid to these events is a critical topic for decision makers and relief experts in order to mitigate impacts and save lives. When a disaster occurs, it is important to acquire first-hand, real-time information about the potentially affected area, its infrastructure, and its people in order to develop situational awareness and plan a response to address the health needs of the affected population. This requires rapid assembly of multi-source geospatial data that need to be organized and visualized in a way to support disaster-relief efforts. In this paper, we introduce a new cyberinfrastructure solution\u2014GeoGraphVis\u2014that is empowered by knowledge graph technology and advanced visualization to enable intelligent decision making and problem solving. There are three innovative features of this solution. First, a location-aware knowledge graph is created to link and integrate cross-domain data to make the graph analytics-ready. Second, expert-driven disaster response workflows are analyzed and modeled as machine-understandable decision paths to guide knowledge exploration via the graph. Third, a scene-based visualization strategy is developed to enable interactive and heuristic visual analytics to better comprehend disaster impact situations and develop action plans for humanitarian aid.",

In this paper, we will explain why spatial data require special treatment, and how and when to semantically lift environmental data to a KG. We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\u2013environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as \u201cwhat is here,\u201d \u201cwhat happened here before,\u201d and \u201chow does this region compare to \u2026\u201d for any region on earth within seconds.",

For data integration and interoperability needs within Knowledge Graphs (KGs), these taxonomies must be translated into formal ontologies. In this paper we present an ontology design pattern for modeling a scientific taxonomy as an ontology. The focus of the pattern is to 1) capture temporal dynamics of concepts as taxonomies evolve, 2) model the provenance of concepts to add context and enable governance, 3) assist the translation of taxonomic relations to ontological relations appropriately that will empower their use within KGs, and 4) tag provenance and other metadata information to mappings or alignments of uncertainty between concepts in different ontologies.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are a rapidly growing paradigm and technology stack for integrating large-scale, heterogeneous data in an AI-ready form, i.e., combining data with the formal semantics required to understand it. However, toolchains that support data synthesis and knowledge discovery through information organization, search, filtering, and visualization have been developed at a pace lagging knowledge graph technology. In this paper, we present Knowledge Explorer, an open-source faceted search interface that provides environmentally intelligent services for interactively browsing and navigating KnowWhereGraph. Currently one of the largest open knowledge graphs, KnowWhereGraph contains over 12 billion statements with rich spatial and temporal information from more than 30 data layers. With an extensive collection of facets, Knowledge Explorer enables spatial, temporal, full-text, and expert search with dereferencing functionality to support \"follow-your-nose\" exploration, and it allows users to narrow their search by selecting facets. Given the size of the underlying graph and dependency on GeoSPARQL, we have improved query performance by implementing Elasticsearch indexing, spatial query generation, and caching. Knowledge Explorer is capable of retrieving information within seconds, answering a wide variety of competency questions posed by researchers, humanitarian relief organizations, and the broader public, thus helping better perform tasks such as cross-gazetteer place retrieval and disaster assessment from global to local geographic scales.",

Often the biggest challenge to improving the effectiveness of the response is quickly finding the right expert, with the right expertise concerning a specific disaster type/disaster and geographic region. To assist in achieving such a goal, this paper demonstrates a knowledge graph-based search engine developed on top of an expert knowledge graph. It accommodates three modes of information retrieval, including a follow-your-nose search, an expert similarity search, and a SPARQL query interface. We will demonstrate utilizing the system to rapidly navigate from a hazard event to a specific expert who may be helpful, for example. More importantly, as the data is fully integrated including links between hazards and their abstract topics, we can find experts who have relevant expertise while navigating the graph.",

The notion of Linked Open Science rests on the assump-tion that Linked Data principles contribute to science and scienti\ufb01c data management in several distinct ways (e.g., by adding rich semantics to improve retrieval and reuse of data). This begs the question of the right level of granularity for such semantic enrichment. On the one extreme of the spectrum, one may provide semantic annotations on the level of entire datasets to improve retrieval while leaving the actual data un-touched. On the other end, one may semantically describe every single datum, such as a particular observation leading to data that supports reasoning, automated con\ufb02ation, and so on, while, at the same time, dra-matically increasing the size of data, including redundancy. This paper reports on our experience in modeling heterogeneous environmental data using a semantically-enabled observation framework, namely the SOSA ontology and its extensions to handle observation collections. We discuss di\ufb00erent means of using these observation collections and compare their pros and cons in terms of data size and ease of querying.",
