            "title": "When Aloha and CSMA Coexist: Modeling, Fairness, and Throughput Optimization",
            "abstract": "With the emerging unlicensed spectrum sharing and Machine-to-Machine communications, the coexistence performance of multiple devices with different access schemes operating at the same unlicensed bands has received significant research interests. As the two most representative random-access schemes, Aloha and Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) both found wide applications in unlicensed bands. Yet most of the studies have focused on the coexistence of CSMA-based networks, leaving the coexistence of Aloha-based and CSMA-based networks largely unexplored. The challenge originates from the lack of a coexistence model of slotted Aloha and CSMA. In this paper, the throughput performance of coexisting Aloha and CSMA networks is characterized and optimized by extending a unified analytical framework proposed for random-access networks. The analysis shows that different from the single-network case where the maximum throughput of CSMA is much higher thanks to carrier sensing, when Aloha and CSMA coexist, Aloha would significantly outperform CSMA if each network optimizes its own throughput performance without cooperation, leading to poor throughput performance for CSMA and severe unfairness. To achieve fair coexistence, inter-network cooperation is crucial. The optimal transmission probabilities of Aloha and CSMA for maximizing the total network throughput under a given throughput ratio are further derived, and applied to coexisting LTE Unlicensed and WiFi networks to optimize their coexistence performance.",

            "title": "Achieving 3GPP Fairness for LTE-U and WiFi Coexisting Networks in Unlicensed Spectrum",
            "abstract": "One of the major challenges for the development of next generation mobile communications is how to meet the growing demand of high data rate with the increasingly scarce spectrum resources. In the past a few years, introducing Long Term Evolution (LTE) into the unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U) has attracted extensive attention, where a key question is how to achieve fair coexistence between LTE-U and WiFi under the unlicensed spectrum. In this paper, we study how to adaptively tune the duty cycle to maintain 3GPP fairness between LTE-U and WiFi with the LTE-U duty-cycling mechanism. Based on a unified analytical model, explicit expression of the optimal duty cycle is derived for achieving 3GPP fairness. The analysis is well verified by simulation results, which provides practical insights on LTE/WiFi coexistence issue.",
