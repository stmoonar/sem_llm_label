            "abstract": "To improve decision-making and prevent information overload, music streaming services try to offer users personalized content. Vocabulary can be an important component in achieving personalization, in addition to recommender systems that ensure users are given access to their musical preferences. One way to apply personalization through vocabulary is to use personal pronouns. However, it is still unclear how the use of vocabulary personalization affects users\u2019 decisions and expectations when it comes to music streaming services. This study aims to explore how vocabulary framing in playlist titles influences decision-making and the content expectations of the music playlist. Despite challenges in making informed vocabulary choices, our results show a substantial impact of personalized vocabulary in playlist titles on user choice and overall expectations. Users distinctly favor playlists with personalized vocabulary, emphasizing their crucial role in enhancing the music streaming experience.",

            "abstract": "Popularity bias in recommendation lists refers to over-representation of popular content and is a challenge for many recommendation algorithms. Previous research has suggested several offline metrics to quantify popularity bias, which commonly relate the popularity of items in users' recommendation lists to the popularity of items in their interaction history. Discrepancies between these two factors are referred to as popularity miscalibration. While popularity metrics provide a straightforward and well-defined means to measure popularity bias, it is unknown whether they actually reflect users' perception of popularity bias. To address this research gap, we conduct a crowd-sourced user study on Prolific, involving 56 participants, to (1) investigate whether the level of perceived popularity miscalibration differs between common recommendation algorithms, (2) assess the correlation between perceived popularity miscalibration and its corresponding quantification according to a common offline metric. We conduct our study in a well-defined and important domain, namely music recommendation using the standardized LFM-2b dataset, and quantify popularity miscalibration of five recommendation algorithms by utilizing Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD). Challenging the findings of previous studies, we observe that users generally do perceive significant differences in terms of popularity bias between algorithms if this bias is framed as popularity miscalibration. In addition, JSD correlates moderately with users' perception of popularity, but not with their perception of unpopularity.",

The seminar addressed technology-enhanced information access (information retrieval, recommender systems, natural language processing) and specifically focused on developing more responsible experimental practices leading to more valid results, both for research as well as for scientific education. The seminar featured a series of long and short talks delivered by participants, who helped in setting a common ground and in letting emerge topics of interest to be explored as the main output of the seminar. This led to the definition of five groups which investigated challenges, opportunities, and next steps in the following areas: reality check, i.e. conducting real-world studies, human-machine-collaborative relevance judgment frameworks, overcoming methodological challenges in information retrieval and recommender systems through awareness and education, results-blind reviewing, and guidance for authors.

Collaborative filtering (CF) approaches are commonly used to leverage behaviors of others with a similar taste to make predictions for the target user. However, CF is prone to introduce or amplify popularity bias in which popular (often consumed or highly ranked) items are prioritized over less popular items. Many computational metrics of popularity biases \u2014 and resulting algorithmic (un)fairness \u2014 have been presented. However, it is largely unclear whether these metrics reflect human perception of bias and fairness. We conducted a user study with 170 participants to explore how users perceive recommendation lists created by algorithms with different degrees of popularity bias. Our results show \u2014 surprisingly \u2014 that popularity biases in recommendation lists are barely observed by users, even when corresponding bias/fairness metrics clearly indicate them.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, the profound digital transformation has upgraded the role of the computational system into an intelligent multidimensional communication medium that creates new opportunities, competencies, models and processes. The need for human-centered adaptation and personalization is even more recognizable since it can offer hybrid solutions that could adequately support the rising multi-purpose goals, needs, requirements, activities and interactions of users. The HAAPIE workshop1 embraces the essence of the \u201chuman-machine co-existence\u201d and brings together researchers and practitioners from different disciplines to present and discuss a wide spectrum of related challenges, approaches and solutions. In this respect, the seventh edition of HAAPIE includes 2 long papers and 5 short papers.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems are prone to triggering choice overload among users due to the typically large set sizes. Various applications have been developed that aim to overcome this through interface design, notably by so-called multi-list recommender systems. However, to what extent such user interface design actually reduces choice overload compared to single-list interfaces has yet to be examined. In a user study ( \ud835\udc41 = 150 ), we compared three common user interfaces (UIs) in the context of recipe recommendation: a single-list UI, a grid UI and a multi-list UI. Whereas earlier studies found differences in choice difficulty and choice satisfaction across grid-based and multi-list recommender interfaces, we observed no such differences, as the explanations were possibly not sufficiently helpful. Instead, we found that grid-based UIs and multi-list UIs had a higher perceived ease of use than a single-list UI, which in turn reduced choice difficulty. The benefits of such interfaces, thus, may lie in the organization of the UI, at least in the recipe domain.",

            "abstract": "In group decision-making, we can frequently observe that an individual adapts their behavior or belief to fit in with the group\u2019s majority opinion. This phenomenon has been widely observed to exist especially against an objectively correct answer\u2014in face-to-face and online interaction alike. To a lesser extent, studies have investigated the conformity effect in settings based on personal opinions and feelings; thus, in settings where an objectively right or wrong answer does not exist. In such settings, the direction of conformity tends to play a role in whether an individual will conform. While cultural differences in conformity behavior have been observed repeatedly in settings with an objectively correct answer, the role of culture has not been explored yet for settings with subjective topics. Hence, the focus of this study is on how conformity develops across cultures for such cases. We developed an online experiment in which participants needed to reach a positive group consensus on adding a song to a music playlist. After seeing the group members\u2019 ratings, the participants had the opportunity to revise their own. Our findings suggest that the willingness to flip to a positive outcome was far less than to a negative outcome. Overall, conformity behavior was far less pronounced for participants from the United Kingdom compared to participants from India.",
