            "title": "Foreword for Workshop on Decision Making for Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "1 FOREWORD Most of the recent progress in information retrieval (IR) and recommender systems has been fueled by deep learning: the success of neural networks has brought tremendous opportunities to model highly complex patterns for prediction. However, algorithmic advances on accurate predictions and improved user modeling are just a small part of designing considerations of a much larger system. IR and recommender systems difer from other machine learning domains because they are inherently part of an ecosystem \u2013 in the simplest case, a world of items and users. In these ecosystems, system designers face a broad range of decisions \u2013 e.g., how to balance popularity, which incentives should be given to which users, or what safeguards to put in place to ensure the platform thrives in the long-run. Some of the decision making problems are statistical and algorithmic in nature, such as coping with the uncertainty of data and models, while others can involve building systems for the satisfactory of multiple parties. In general, there are many complex decision-making challenges faced by real-world IR and recommender systems, but existing approaches often make oversimplifed assumptions about the environment, data, and human behavior. Ignoring those challenges or treating them simply as pattern recognition problems can cost the engagement, accessibility, fairness, inclusiveness, and ultimately the vitality of IR and recommendation systems.",

            "abstract": "We provide an overview of the recent trends toward digitalization and large-scale data analytics in healthcare. It is expected that these trends are instrumental in the dramatic changes in the way healthcare will be organized in the future. We discuss the recent political initiatives designed to shift care delivery processes from paper to electronic, with the goals of more effective treatments with better outcomes; cost pressure is a major driver of innovation. We describe newly developed networks of healthcare providers, research organizations, and commercial vendors to jointly analyze data for the development of decision support systems. We address the trend toward continuous healthcare where health is monitored by wearable and stationary devices; a related development is that patients increasingly assume responsibility for their own health data. Finally, we discuss recent initiatives toward a personalized medicine, based on advances in molecular medicine, data management, and data analytics.",
