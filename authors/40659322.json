            "title": "Beyond Accuracy: Investigating Error Types in GPT-4 Responses to USMLE Questions",
            "abstract": "GPT-4 demonstrates high accuracy in medical QA tasks, leading with an accuracy of 86.70%, followed by Med-PaLM 2 at 86.50%. However, around 14% of errors remain. Additionally, current works use GPT-4 to only predict the correct option without providing any explanation and thus do not provide any insight into the thinking process and reasoning used by GPT-4 or other LLMs. Therefore, we introduce a new domain-specific error taxonomy derived from collaboration with medical students. Our GPT-4 USMLE Error (G4UE) dataset comprises 4153 GPT-4 correct responses and 919 incorrect responses to the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) respectively. These responses are quite long (258 words on average), containing detailed explanations from GPT-4 justifying the selected option. We then launch a large-scale annotation study using the Potato annotation platform and recruit 44 medical experts through Prolific, a well-known crowdsourcing platform. We annotated 300 out of these 919 incorrect data points at a granular level for different classes and created a multi-label span to identify the reasons behind the error. In our annotated dataset, a substantial portion of GPT-4's incorrect responses is categorized as a\"Reasonable response by GPT-4,\"by annotators. This sheds light on the challenge of discerning explanations that may lead to incorrect options, even among trained medical professionals. We also provide medical concepts and medical semantic predications extracted using the SemRep tool for every data point. We believe that it will aid in evaluating the ability of LLMs to answer complex medical questions. We make the resources available at https://github.com/roysoumya/usmle-gpt4-error-taxonomy .",

            "abstract": "Extant literature has explored the social integration process of migrants settling in host communities. However, this literature typically takes a migrant-centric view, implicitly putting the burden of a successful integration on the migrant, and trying to identify the factors that lead to integration along various dimensions. In this paper, we flip this point of view by studying the attributes of natives that govern their propensity to form social ties with migrants.We do so by using anonymous and aggregate social network data provided by Facebook\u2019s advertising platform. More specifically, we look at factors that influence the propensity for a likely-to-be non-Muslim Facebook user to have at least one social connection to a Facebook user who celebrates Ramadan. Given that, in the European context, following Islam is predominantly tied to a migration background, this gives us a lens into cross-cultural native-migrant connectivity. Our study considers demographic attributes of the host population, such as age, gender, and education level, as well as spatial variation across 30 European cities. Our findings suggest that young, educated, and male Facebook users are relatively more likely to build cross-cultural ties, compared to older, less educated, and female Facebook users. We also observe heterogeneity across the analyzed cities.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: AI-based NLP literature has explored antipathy toward the marginalized section of society, such as migrants, and their social acceptance. Broadly, extant literature has conceptualized this as an online hate speech detection task and employed predictive ML models. However, a crucial omission in this literature is the genesis (or causality) of online hate, i.e., why do we hate migrants? Drawing insights from social science literature, we have identified three antecedents of online hate: Cultural, Economic, and Security concerns. Subsequently, we probe -which of these concerns triggers higher toxicity on online platforms? Initially, we consider OLS-based regression analysis and SHAP framework to identify the predictors of toxicity, and subsequently, we use Double Machine Learning (DML)-based casual analysis to investigate whether good predictors of toxicity are also causally significant. We find that the causal effect of Cultural concerns on toxicity is higher than Security and Economic concerns.",

Contrarily, our study attempts to identify the various stages of their journey from displacement to emplacement in the host nation. We draw insights from Gennep's seminal work, i.e., Les Rites de Passage, to identify four phases of the refugee journey: Arrival of Refugees, Temporal stay at Asylums, Rehabilitation, and Integration of Refugees into the host nation. To test our proposed framework, we have collected multimodal tweets from April 15, 2020, to March 15, 2021. A fusion of BERT+LSTM (for text inputs) and InceptionV4 (for image inputs) has reported an F1-score of 80.93%. Subsequently, to test the practical implication of our proposed model in real-time, we have considered the multimodal tweets related to the 2022 Ukrainian refugee crisis. An F1-score of 71.88 % for this 2022 crisis confirms the generalizability of our proposed framework.",

However, the literature has rarely probed \u2013 whether these negative sentiments get endorsed by other users? If yes, does it depend on who the migrants are \u2013 especially if they are cultural others? The 2022 Ukrainian refugee crisis allows probing these intricate issues. We have analyzed 110,803 (prior to this 2022 crisis) and 21,453 (during this crisis) migrant-related comments on the YouTube platform. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between user endorsement and sentiments of these comments. Both datasets indicate that users endorse comments with positive sentiments and reveal a negative propensity to endorse hate speeches, i.e., comments that use swear words. However, the analysis of the recent dataset reveals a negative propensity to endorse comments with negative sentiments, but the earlier dataset indicates a positive propensity. Thus, the endorsement pattern of comments with negative sentiments may depend on who the migrants are!",

We have collected 0.15 million tweets, but only 2% of these tweets are the voices of migrants and refugees. In addition to non-refugee and non-migrant voices, we have classified their voices into three themes as follows: their generic views, initial struggles, and subsequent settlement in the host country. We have employed deep learning and transformer-based models for identifying these themes. Our best-performing transformer-based model has reported an accuracy of 75.89%.

We argue that the context-specific application of AI, compared to generic approaches, is more efficient in retrieving meaningful insights from social media data for SCM.

Subsequently, we have identified specific areas of SCM where context-aware sentiment analysis can enhance the overall efficiency.",

Our theoretical anchoring helped us in identifying two prevailing perceptions (i.e., sympathy and antipathy) and two dominant behaviors (i.e., solidarity and animosity) of social media users towards migrants. We have employed unsupervised and supervised approaches to identify these perceptions and behaviors. In the domain of applied NLP, our study offers a nuanced understanding of migrant-related Twitter deliberations. Our proposed transformer-based model, i.e., BERT + CNN, has reported an F1-score of 0.76 and outperformed other models. Additionally, we argue that tweets conveying antipathy or animosity can be broadly considered hate speech towards migrants, but they are not the same. Thus, our approach has fine-tuned the binary hate speech detection task by highlighting the granular differences between perceptual and behavioral aspects of hate speeches.",
