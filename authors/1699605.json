            "abstract": "Polycube layouts for 3D models effectively support a wide variety of applications such as hexahedral mesh construction, seamless texture mapping, spline fitting, and multi-block grid generation. However, the automated construction of valid polycube layouts suffers from robustness issues: the state-of-the-art deformation-based methods are not guaranteed to find a valid solution. In this paper we present a novel approach which is guaranteed to return a valid polycube layout for 3D models of genus 0. Our algorithm is based on a dual representation of polycubes; we construct polycube layouts by iteratively adding or removing dual loops. The iterative nature of our algorithm facilitates a seamless trade-off between quality and complexity of the solution. Our method is efficient and can be implemented using comparatively simple algorithmic building blocks. We experimentally compare the results of our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods. Our fully automated method always produces provably valid polycube layouts whose quality - assessed via the quality of derived hexahedral meshes - is on par with state-of-the-art deformation methods.",

            "title": "An Interleaving Distance for Ordered Merge Trees",
            "abstract": "Merge trees are a common topological descriptor for data with a hierarchical component, such as terrains and scalar fields. The interleaving distance, in turn, is a common distance measure for comparing merge trees. However, the interleaving distance for merge trees is solely based on the hierarchical structure, and disregards any other geometrical or topological properties that might be present in the underlying data. Furthermore, the interleaving distance is NP-hard to compute. In this paper, we introduce a form of ordered merge trees that does capture intrinsic order present in the data. We further define a natural variant of the interleaving distance, the monotone interleaving distance, which is an order preserving distance measure for ordered merge trees. Analogous to the regular interleaving distance for merge trees, we show that the monotone variant has three equivalent definitions in terms of two maps, a single map, or a labelling. The labelling-based definition fairly directly leads to an efficient algorithm for computing the monotone interleaving distance, but unfortunately it computes only an approximation thereof. Instead, we discover a surprising connection between the monotone interleaving distance of ordered merge trees and the Fr\\'{e}chet distance of 1D curves. As a result, the monotone interleaving distance between two ordered merge trees of total complexity $n$ can be computed exactly in $\\tilde O(n^2)$ time. The connection between the monotone interleaving distance and the Fr\\'{e}chet distance establishes a new bridge between the fields of computational topology/topological data analysis, where interleaving distances are studied extensively, and computational geometry, where Fr\\'{e}chet distances are studied extensively.",

            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

Each step of such a pipeline potentially amplifies any uncertainties from the previous step. To ensure the comprehensibility and interoperability of the results, it is of paramount importance to clearly communicate the uncertainty not only of the output but also within the pipeline. In this paper, we characterize the sources of uncertainty along the visual text analysis pipeline. Within its three phases of labeling, modeling, and analysis, we identify six sources, discuss the type of uncertainty they create, and how they propagate. The goal of this paper is to bring the attention of the visualization community to additional types and sources of uncertainty in visual text analysis and to call for careful consideration, highlighting opportunities for future research.",

            "abstract": "An important data source for traffic analysis is GPS trajectory data. However, due to measurement inaccuracies, such data does not necessarily align well with data describing the road network. Hence, GPS data typically needs to be aligned with the road network before further analysis can take place; this process is called map matching. The challenges in map matching are exacerbated when trajectories are sparse (have a low measurement frequency); we then need to fill the gaps between the measurements with a realistic estimate of the actual route between two points. As vehicle movement is subject to physical constraints (such as acceleration and speed bounds), an estimated route should be physically consistent. We present a method that creates physically consistent estimated routes to perform map matching for sparse trajectories.",

            "title": "Fast Reconfiguration for Programmable Matter",
            "abstract": "The concept of programmable matter envisions a very large number of tiny and simple robot particles forming a smart material. Even though the particles are restricted to local communication, local movement, and simple computation, their actions can nevertheless result in the global change of the material's physical properties and geometry. A fundamental algorithmic task for programmable matter is to achieve global shape reconfiguration by specifying local behavior of the particles. In this paper we describe a new approach for shape reconfiguration in the amoebot model. The amoebot model is a distributed model which significantly restricts memory, computing, and communication capacity of the individual particles. Thus the challenge lies in coordinating the actions of particles to produce the desired behavior of the global system. Our reconfiguration algorithm is the first algorithm that does not use a canonical intermediate configuration when transforming between arbitrary shapes. We introduce new geometric primitives for amoebots and show how to reconfigure particle systems, using these primitives, in a linear number of activation rounds in the worst case. In practice, our method exploits the geometry of the symmetric difference between input and output shape: it minimizes unnecessary disassembly and reassembly of the particle system when the symmetric difference between the initial and the target shapes is small. Furthermore, our reconfiguration algorithm moves the particles over as many parallel shortest paths as the problem instance allows.",

As such, it may provide useful methods to explore spatial representations of linguistic data (embeddings) which have become central in NLP. In this paper we aim to introduce TDA to researchers in language technology. We use TDA to represent document structure as so-called story trees. Story trees are hierarchical representations created from semantic vector representations of sentences via persistent homology. They can be used to identify and clearly visualize prominent components of a story line. We showcase their potential by using story trees to create extractive summaries for news stories.",

            "abstract": "Bias elimination and recent probing studies attempt to remove specific information from embedding spaces. Here it is important to remove as much of the target information as possible, while preserving any other information present. INLP is a popular recent method which removes specific information through iterative nullspace projections.Multiple iterations, however, increase the risk that information other than the target is negatively affected.We introduce two methods that find a single targeted projection: Mean Projection (MP, more efficient) and Tukey Median Projection (TMP, with theoretical guarantees). Our comparison between MP and INLP shows that (1) one MP projection removes linear separability based on the target and (2) MP has less impact on the overall space.Further analysis shows that applying random projections after MP leads to the same overall effects on the embedding space as the multiple projections of INLP. Applying one targeted (MP) projection hence is methodologically cleaner than applying multiple (INLP) projections that introduce random effects.",

Tracking such groups is an important analysis task in a variety of areas, such as wildlife ecology, urban transport, or sports analysis. Correspondingly, recent years have seen a multitude of algorithms to identify and track meaningful groups in sets of moving entities. However, not only the mere existence of one or more groups is an important fact to discover; in many application areas the actual shape of the group carries meaning as well. In this paper we initiate the algorithmic study of the shape of a moving group. We use kernel density estimation to model the density within a group and show how to e\ufb03ciently maintain an approximation of this density description over time. Furthermore, we track persistent maxima which give a meaningful \ufb01rst idea of the time-varying shape of the group. By combining several approximation techniques, we obtain a kinetic data structure that can approximately track persistent maxima e\ufb03ciently. 2012 ACM Subject Classi\ufb01cation Theory of computation \u2192 Design and analysis of algorithms",
