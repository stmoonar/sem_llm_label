            "abstract": "Millimeter-wave(mmWave) communication is a key technology that enables autonomous vehicles and roadside units to collaborate in environment perception, thereby improving traffic efficiency and safety to a new level. Some recent works have focused on relay-based solutions to overcome inherent defects of mmWave, such as severe path loss and high sensitivity to obstacles. However, they both neglect the selfish behaviors of vehicles. Considering the application-oriented nature of vehicular communication, we propose an information value-based relay strategy in this article to characterize the selfishness of vehicles, which enables vehicles to make relay decisions through the value assessment of messages. Specifically, an extensible relay probability model is introduced to evaluate the information value based on the required awareness range of vehicles. By using stochastic geometry (SG), we construct an integrated three-dimensional (3D) system model for the vehicular relay-based vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) mmWave downlink, and derive the exact expressions of both blockage and outage probabilities. Simulations verify the analytical results and reveal the highest connection reliability of the vehicle exists and relies on both network- and application-related parameters. Moreover, the selfishness of vehicles deteriorates the connection reliability, especially under the conditions of the small information value of forwarded messages. These results laid the foundation for the further expansion of the information value-based relay strategies to a wider range of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of digital twin technology is expected to reduce the significant cost of traditional physical debugging. Moreover, it can also fully combine IoT real-time data, large data analysis, and simulation, to make the best decisions. In the digital twin network, the data distribution and computing power of different device nodes shows great heterogeneity, but the internal node data are independent and identically distributed. Therefore, our learning algorithm should be able to learn not only the network commonality, but also the node specificity. In order to provide secure and personalised services for different device nodes, a polymorphic learning (PL) framework is proposed in this paper. PL divides the classical neural network model into a homomorphic model and a polymorphic model to realise flexible network control. Finally, the advantages of the PL algorithm in the collaborative optimisation of different nodes are proven through simulation experiments, and the algorithm running process is simulated through a classic case, with the final results proving the superiority of the algorithm.",

            "abstract": "This paper proposes a scene frame prediction system based on digital twin technology. The system is mainly composed of an unmanned perception module, a communication link module, a command center module that provides intelligent computing services, and an interaction and visualization module for human operators. These modules together constitute a system for predicting and recovery the time-series matrix composed of scene frames and object frames. At the same time, in view of the current problems of lack of real-time information and long response time in the maritime search and rescue (SAR) field, this paper instantiates the above system to improve the existing SAR system. Satellites and unmanned vehicles perceive part of the scene data of the real cyber-physical system in real-time and divide them into multiple frames according to the timestamps. In addition, this paper also proposes an environmental graph-attention network (Env-GAT) to achieve efficient and reliable frame predicting. Finally, this paper verifies that the performance of the spatiotemporal attention graph network model has reached the optimal level through computational experiments.",

To avoid the congestion, the partitioning principle considered avoiding congestion is developed in this paper. And the applicability of the partitioning requires the threshold of partitioning principle which is provided the computable formula based on traffic shock-wave theory and platoon dispersion theory in this paper. The coordination control with partitioning considered congestion factor and coordinability benefit reduces 42.0% to 80.7% traffic congestion compared with the isolated control in the simulation software Vissim.",
