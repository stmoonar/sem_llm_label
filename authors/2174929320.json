            "title": "Should I Sample it or Not? Improving Quality Assurance Efficiency Through Smart Active Sampling",
            "abstract": "The digital transformation provides industries with unparalleled opportunities for value creation. AI and Machine learning (AI/ML)-driven approaches for data analysis applied to the massive amounts of data steaming from industrial processes can lead to enhanced operation, costs reduction, and powerful decision-making strategies. In this paper we address the problem of Quality Assurance (QA) in industrial manufacturing. We propose Smart Active Sampling (SAS), a new QA sampling strategy for quality inspection outside the production line. Based on the principles of active learning, an AI/ML model trained for quality prediction decides which produced pieces or samples are sent to quality inspection, to further improve its own prediction accuracy. SAS reduces the production of scrap parts due to earlier detection of quality violations. By inspecting a much lower number of samples as compared to traditional random sampling approaches, SAS improves QA efficiency and cuts down quality inspection costs, resulting in an overall smoother operation. We elaborate on some of the challenges faced in smart sampling strategies for quality inspection, describe the main concepts behind SAS, and showcase its application in a real-world manufacturing QA use case, training an AI/ML model for product defect prediction. Compared to a standard random sampling strategy, widely applied today in industrial QA applications, SAS improves model prediction accuracy requiring a significantly lower number of inspected samples, up to five time less samples in the analyzed dataset.",

            "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly explored in various domains and industries. Many companies experiment with AI, but too often those experiments are one-off analyses based on outdated data and the resulting models never make it into production. This paper proposes a framework for building and operating AI models at the industrial edge. The center of this framework is the model artifact, a model-generating entity. We analyze three AI model use-cases and user roles involved in industrial AI applications to illustrate the challenges in deploying and operating AI applications in industrial edge scenarios. We propose to structure the AI models into predefined artifacts that enable deployments with only a few clicks. The edge device links sensor data with the model input and returns the model output as feedback back into the industrial process. Model training, deployment, and management can be carried out in a scalable manner even by a non-expert. Several models can be managed in parallel, and data can be linked to the respective sensor or machine.",

Federated learning (FL) enables multiple participants to develop a machine learning model without compromising the privacy and confidentiality of their data.

Our study is based on four datasets with varying data distributions. The results indicate that the performance of FL is highly dependent on the data and its distribution among clients.

            "abstract": "Vibration-based condition monitoring systems are receiving increasing attention due to their ability to accurately identify different conditions by capturing dynamic features over a broad frequency range. However, there is little research on clustering approaches in vibration data and the resulting solutions are often optimized for a single data set. In this work, we present an extensive comparison of the clustering algorithms K-means clustering, OPTICS, and Gaussian mixture model clustering (GMM) applied to statistical features extracted from the time and frequency domains of vibration data sets. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of feature combinations, feature selection using principal component analysis (PCA), and the specified number of clusters on the performance of the clustering algorithms. We conducted this comparison in terms of a grid search using three different benchmark data sets. Our work showed that averaging (Mean, Median) and variance-based features (Standard Deviation, Interquartile Range) performed significantly better than shape-based features (Skewness, Kurtosis). In addition, K-means outperformed GMM slightly for these data sets, whereas OPTICS performed significantly worse. We were also able to show that feature combinations as well as PCA feature selection did not result in any significant performance improvements. With an increase in the specified number of clusters, clustering algorithms performed better, although there were some specific algorithmic restrictions.",

Industrial Federated Learning (IFL) offers a promising solution by enabling collaborative training across multiple industrial devices, while keeping data on-premises. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for supporting the development, deployment, integration and execution of IFL solutions. The proposed method provides a lifecycle management of FL artifacts and supports FL as a Service (FlaaS). This enables the extensibility and customizability of FL-based edge applications in industrial settings. Additionally, we introduce a federated clustering algorithm that we have integrated into a condition monitoring app running on client locations to evaluate the proposed lifecycle management. We run two scenarios with four and 33 clients using real-world time series data from industrial pumps. Our results show the applicability of the implemented lifecycle management and demonstrates that privacy-preserving approaches compete well with privacy-disclosing ones.",

            "abstract": "Anomaly detection in large industrial cooling systems is very challenging due to the high data dimensionality, inconsistent sensor recordings, and lack of labels. The state of the art for automated anomaly detection in these systems typically relies on expert knowledge and thresholds. However, data is viewed isolated and complex, multivariate relationships are neglected. In this work, we present an autoencoder based end-to-end workflow for anomaly detection suitable for multivariate time series data in large industrial cooling systems, including explained fault localization and root cause analysis based on expert knowledge. We identify system failures using a threshold on the total reconstruction error (autoencoder reconstruction error including all sensor signals). For fault localization, we compute the individual reconstruction error (autoencoder reconstruction error for each sensor signal) allowing us to identify the signals that contribute most to the total reconstruction error. Expert knowledge is provided via look-up table enabling root-cause analysis and assignment to the affected subsystem. We demonstrated our findings in a cooling system unit including 34 sensors over a 8-months\u2019 time period using 4-fold cross validation approaches and automatically created labels based on thresholds provided by domain experts. Using 4-fold cross validation, we reached a F1-score of 0.56, whereas the autoencoder results showed a higher consistency score (CS of 0.92) compared to the automatically created labels (CS of 0.62) \u2013 indicating that theanomaly is recognized in a very stable manner. The automatically created labels, however, detected anomaly earlier. The main anomaly was found by the autoencoder and automatically created labels, and was also recorded in the log files. Further, the explained fault localization highlighted the most affected component for the main anomaly in a very consistent manner.",

            "title": "Transfer Learning Strategies for Anomaly Detection in IoT Vibration Data",
            "abstract": "An increasing number of industrial assets are equipped with IoT sensor platforms and the industry now expects data-driven maintenance strategies with minimal deployment costs. However, gathering labeled training data for supervised tasks such as anomaly detection is costly and often difficult to implement in operational environments. Therefore, this work aims to design and implement a solution that reduces the required amount of data for training anomaly classification models on time series sensor data and thereby brings down the overall deployment effort of IoT anomaly detection sensors. We set up several in-lab experiments using three peristaltic pumps and investigated approaches for transferring trained anomaly detection models across assets of the same type. Our experiments achieved promising effectiveness and provide initial evidence that transfer learning could be a suitable strategy for using pre-trained anomaly classification models across industrial assets of the same type with minimal prior labeling and training effort. This work could serve as a starting point for more general, pre-trained sensor data embeddings, applicable to a wide range of assets.",
