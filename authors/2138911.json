            "title": "Boosted Off-Policy Learning",
            "abstract": "We propose the first boosting algorithm for off-policy learning from logged bandit feedback. Unlike existing boosting methods for supervised learning, our algorithm directly optimizes an estimate of the policy's expected reward. We analyze this algorithm and prove that the excess empirical risk decreases (possibly exponentially fast) with each round of boosting, provided a ''weak'' learning condition is satisfied by the base learner. We further show how to reduce the base learner to supervised learning, which opens up a broad range of readily available base learners with practical benefits, such as decision trees. Experiments indicate that our algorithm inherits many desirable properties of tree-based boosting algorithms (e.g., robustness to feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning), and that it can outperform off-policy learning with deep neural networks as well as methods that simply regress on the observed rewards.",

            "abstract": "We present a Bayesian view of counterfactual risk minimization (CRM) for offline learning from logged bandit feedback. Using PAC-Bayesian analysis, we derive a new generalization bound for the truncated inverse propensity score estimator. We apply the bound to a class of Bayesian policies, which motivates a novel, potentially data-dependent, regularization technique for CRM. Experimental results indicate that this technique outperforms standard $L_2$ regularization, and that it is competitive with variance regularization while being both simpler to implement and more computationally efficient.",

We have defined a systems model that integrates assembly data, comparative genomics, gene predictions, mRNA and EST alignments and physiological tissue expression. Using these as predictive parameters, we engineered a machine learning approach to decipher putative active regions in the genome.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of genomic sequences showed nucleosome-free region (NFR) modules containing a higher percentage of conserved regions, RNA-encoding sequences, CpG islands, splice sites and GC-rich areas. In contrast, random in silico fragments revealed higher percentages of DNA repeats and a lower conservation. The larger conserved sequences from the Vista enhancer browser (VEB) showed a greater percentage of short DNA sequence matches and RNA coding regions in multiple species. Our model can predict small regulatory regions in the genome with >95% prediction accuracy using NFR modules and >85% prediction accuracy with VEB elements. Ultimately, this systems model can be applied to any organism to identify candidate transcriptional modules on a genome scale.",

            "abstract": "A pervasive problem in large relational databases is identity uncertainty which occurs when multiple entries in a database refer to the same underlying entity in the world. Relational databases exhibit rich graphical structure and are naturally modeled as graphs whose nodes represent entities and whose typed-edges represent relations between them. We propose using random walk models for resolving identity uncertainty since they have proven effective for finding points which are proximately located in a network. Because not all types of relations are equally helpful in alleviating identity uncertainty, we develop a supervised approach to learning the usefulness of different database relations from a training set of database entries whose true identities are known. When tested on the task of resolving uncertainty of ambiguously named authors in bibliographical data, the learned random walk models yield performance superior to support vector machines, and to a related spectral clustering method.",

Unlike most network alignment methods, QSim finds local matches for one network in another, making it asymmetric, and takes full advantage of different edge types. We use QSim to simulate a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network from D. melanogaster using a PPI network from S. cerevisiae, and compare QSim's alignment to those from other methods using Gene Ontology (GO) biological process annotations as proxies for correct alignment matches. The best cross-species protein matches obtained from QSim have a higher agreement in GO biological process annotations than those from either BLAST or an alternative network alignment algorithm.",

            "abstract": "For many supervised learning problems, we possess prior knowledge about which features yield similar information about the target variable. In predicting the topic of a document, we might know that two words are synonyms, and when performing image recognition, we know which pixels are adjacent. Such synonymous or neighboring features are near-duplicates and should be expected to have similar weights in an accurate model. Here we present a framework for regularized learning when one has prior knowledge about which features are expected to have similar and dissimilar weights. The prior knowledge is encoded as a network whose vertices are features and whose edges represent similarities and dissimilarities between them. During learning, each feature's weight is penalized by the amount it differs from the average weight of its neighbors. For text classification, regularization using networks of word co-occurrences outperforms manifold learning and compares favorably to other recently proposed semi-supervised learning methods. For sentiment analysis, feature networks constructed from declarative human knowledge significantly improve prediction accuracy.",
