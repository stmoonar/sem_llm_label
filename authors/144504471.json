            "abstract": "Data management is a critical component of modern experimental workflows. As data generation rates increase, transferring data from acquisition servers to processing servers via conventional file-based methods is becoming increasingly impractical. The 4D Camera at the National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM) generates data at a nominal rate of 480 Gbit/s (87,000 frames/s) producing a 700 GB dataset in fifteen seconds. To address the challenges associated with storing and processing such quantities of data, we developed a streaming workflow that utilizes a high-speed network to connect the 4D Camera's data acquisition (DAQ) system to supercomputing nodes at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), bypassing intermediate file storage entirely. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our streaming pipeline in a production setting through an hour-long experiment that generated over 10 TB of raw data, yielding high-quality datasets suitable for advanced analyses. Additionally, we compare the efficacy of this streaming workflow against the conventional file-transfer workflow by conducting a post-mortem analysis on historical data from experiments performed by real users. Our findings show that the streaming workflow significantly improves data turnaround time, enables real-time decision-making, and minimizes the potential for human error by eliminating manual user interactions.",

            "title": "Accelerating Time-to-Science by Streaming Detector Data Directly into Perlmutter Compute Nodes",
            "abstract": "Recent advancements in detector technology have significantly increased the size and complexity of experimental data, and high-performance computing (HPC) provides a path towards more efficient and timely data processing. However, movement of large data sets from acquisition systems to HPC centers introduces bottlenecks owing to storage I/O at both ends. This manuscript introduces a streaming workflow designed for an high data rate electron detector that streams data directly to compute node memory at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), thereby avoiding storage I/O. The new workflow deploys ZeroMQ-based services for data production, aggregation, and distribution for on-the-fly processing, all coordinated through a distributed key-value store. The system is integrated with the detector's science gateway and utilizes the NERSC Superfacility API to initiate streaming jobs through a web-based frontend. Our approach achieves up to a 14-fold increase in data throughput and enhances predictability and reliability compared to a I/O-heavy file-based transfer workflow. Our work highlights the transformative potential of streaming workflows to expedite data analysis for time-sensitive experiments.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "The Superfacility model is designed to leverage HPC for experimental science. It is more than simply a model of connected experiment, network, and HPC facilities; it encompasses the full ecosystem of infrastructure, software, tools, and expertise needed to make connected facilities easy to use. The three-year Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Superfacility project was initiated in 2019 to coordinate work being performed at LBNL to support this model, and to provide a coherent and comprehensive set of science requirements to drive existing and new work. A key component of the project was the in-depth engagements with eight science teams that represent challenging use cases across the DOE Office of Science. By the close of the project, we met our project goal by enabling our science application engagements to demonstrate automated pipelines that analyze data from remote facilities at large scale, without routine human intervention. In several cases, we have gone beyond demonstrations and now provide production-level services. To achieve this goal, the Superfacility team developed tools, infrastructure, and policies for near-real-time computing support, dynamic high-performance networking, data management and movement tools, API-driven automation, HPC-scale notebooks via Jupyter, authentication using Federated Identity and container-based edge services supported. The lessons we learned during this project provide a valuable model for future large, complex, cross-disciplinary collaborations. There is a pressing need for a coherent computing infrastructure across national facilities, and LBNL's Superfacility project is a unique model for success in tackling the challenges that will be faced in hardware, software, policies, and services across multiple science domains.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit: Tightening the Integration between Computing Facilities and Scientific Workflows",
            "abstract": "The importance of workflows is highlighted by the fact that they have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past decades. Many of these workflows have significant computational, storage, and communication demands, and thus must execute on a range of large-scale computer systems, from local clusters to public clouds and upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Historically, infrastructures for workflow execution consisted of complex, integrated systems, developed in-house by workflow practitioners with strong dependencies on a range of legacy technologies. Due to the increasing need to support workflows, dedicated workflow systems were developed to provide abstractions for creating, executing, and adapting workflows conveniently and efficiently while ensuring portability. While these efforts are all worthwhile individually, there are now hundreds of independent workflow systems. The resulting workflow system technology landscape is fragmented, which may present significant barriers for future workflow users due to many seemingly comparable, yet usually mutually incompatible, systems that exist. In order to tackle some of these challenges, the DOE-funded ExaWorks and NSF-funded WorkflowsRI projects have organized in 2021 a series of events entitled the\"Workflows Community Summit\". The third edition of the ``Workflows Community Summit\"explored workflows challenges and opportunities from the perspective of computing centers and facilities. The third summit brought together a small group of facilities representatives with the aim to understand how workflows are currently being used at each facility, how facilities would like to interact with workflow developers and users, how workflows fit with facility roadmaps, and what opportunities there are for tighter integration between facilities and workflows.

            "abstract": "Network monitoring services are of enormous importance to ensure optimal performance is being delivered and help determine any failing services. Particularly for large data transfers, checking key performance indicators like throughput, packet loss, and latency can make or break experiment results. However, network monitoring tools are very diverse in metrics collected and dependent on the devices installed. Additionally, there are limited tools that can learn and determine the cause of degraded performance. This paper presents NetGraf, a novel end-to-end learning monitoring system that utilizes current monitoring tools, merges multiple data sources into one dashboard for easy use, and provides machine learning libraries to analyze the data and perform real-time anomaly finding. Using a database backend, NetGraf can learn performance trends and show users if network performance has degraded. We demonstrate how NetGraf can easily be deployed through automation services and linked to multiple monitoring sources to collect data. Via the machine learning innovation and merging various data sources, NetGraf aims to fulfill the need for holistic learning network telemetry monitoring. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-ever end-to-end learning monitoring service. We demonstrate its use on two network setups to showcase its impact.",

Beamline operators need to find mechanisms that facilitate easy access for experimenters to their data (with appropriate access control) but that host it externally, to quickly free up constrained local storage capacity. Here, we show how HPC and network facilities can be coupled to a light source facility to build an efficient, low-maintenance data distribution platform.",

            "abstract": "Experimental and observational instruments for scientific research (such as light sources, genome sequencers, accelerators, telescopes and electron microscopes) increasingly require High Performance Computing (HPC) scale capabilities for data analysis and workflow processing. Next-generation instruments are being deployed with higher resolutions and faster data capture rates, creating a big data crunch that cannot be handled by modest institutional computing resources. Often these big data analysis pipelines also require near real-time computing and have higher resilience requirements than the simulation and modeling workloads more traditionally seen at HPC centers. While some facilities have enabled workflows to run at a single HPC facility, there is a growing need to integrate capabilities across HPC facilities to enable cross-facility workflows, either to provide resilience to an experiment, increase analysis throughput capabilities, or to better match a workflow to a particular architecture. In this paper we describe the barriers to executing complex data analysis workflows across HPC facilities and propose an architectural design pattern for enabling scientific discovery using cross-facility workflows that includes orchestration services, application programming interfaces (APIs), data access and co-scheduling.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows are a cornerstone of modern scientific computing, and they have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the last decade. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Workflows will play a crucial role in the data-oriented and post-Moore's computing landscape as they democratize the application of cutting-edge research techniques, computationally intensive methods, and use of new computing platforms. As workflows continue to be adopted by scientific projects and user communities, they are becoming more complex. Workflows are increasingly composed of tasks that perform computations such as short machine learning inference, multi-node simulations, long-running machine learning model training, amongst others, and thus increasingly rely on heterogeneous architectures that include CPUs but also GPUs and accelerators. The workflow management system (WMS) technology landscape is currently segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems that exist. Another fundamental problem is that there are conflicting theoretical bases and abstractions for a WMS. Systems that use the same underlying abstractions can likely be translated between, which is not the case for systems that use different abstractions.
