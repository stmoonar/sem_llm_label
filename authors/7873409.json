            "title": "Unveiling the Potential of Knowledge-Prompted ChatGPT for Enhancing Drug Trafficking Detection on Social Media",
            "abstract": "Social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter have emerged as critical channels for drug marketing and illegal sale. Detecting and labeling online illicit drug trafficking activities becomes important in addressing this issue. However, the effectiveness of conventional supervised learning methods in detecting drug trafficking heavily relies on having access to substantial amounts of labeled data, while data annotation is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Furthermore, these models often face challenges in accurately identifying trafficking activities when drug dealers use deceptive language and euphemisms to avoid detection. To overcome this limitation, we conduct the first systematic study on leveraging large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to detect illicit drug trafficking activities on social media. We propose an analytical framework to compose \\emph{knowledge-informed prompts}, which serve as the interface that humans can interact with and use LLMs to perform the detection task. Additionally, we design a Monte Carlo dropout based prompt optimization method to further to improve performance and interpretability. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other baseline language models in terms of drug trafficking detection accuracy, showing a remarkable improvement of nearly 12\\%. By integrating prior knowledge and the proposed prompts, ChatGPT can effectively identify and label drug trafficking activities on social networks, even in the presence of deceptive language and euphemisms used by drug dealers to evade detection. The implications of our research extend to social networks, emphasizing the importance of incorporating prior knowledge and scenario-based prompts into analytical tools to improve online security and public safety.",

            "abstract": "The explosive growth of cyber attacks today, such as malware, spam, and intrusions, has caused severe consequences on society. Securing cyberspace has become a great concern for organizations and governments. Traditional machine learning based methods are extensively used in detecting cyber threats, but they hardly model the correlations between real-world cyber entities. In recent years, with the proliferation of graph mining techniques, many researchers have investigated these techniques for capturing correlations between cyber entities and achieving high performance. It is imperative to summarize existing graph-based cybersecurity solutions to provide a guide for future studies. Therefore, as a key contribution of this work, we provide a comprehensive review of graph mining for cybersecurity, including an overview of cybersecurity tasks, the typical graph mining techniques, and the general process of applying them to cybersecurity, as well as various solutions for different cybersecurity tasks. For each task, we probe into relevant methods and highlight the graph types, graph approaches, and task levels in their modeling. Furthermore, we collect open datasets and toolkits for graph-based cybersecurity. Finally, we present an outlook on the potential directions of this field for future research.",

            "abstract": "Spatiotemporal graph represents a crucial data structure where the nodes and edges are embedded in a geometric space and their attribute values can evolve dynamically over time. Nowadays, spatiotemporal graph data is becoming increasingly popular and important, ranging from microscale (e.g. protein folding), to middle-scale (e.g. dynamic functional connectivity), to macro-scale (e.g. human mobility network). Although disentangling and understanding the correlations among spatial, temporal, and graph aspects have been a long-standing key topic in network science, they typically rely on network processes hypothesized by human knowledge. They usually fit well towards the properties that the predefined principles are tailored for, but usually cannot do well for the others, especially for many key domains where the human has yet very limited knowledge such as protein folding and biological neuronal networks. In this paper, we aim at pushing forward the modeling and understanding of spatiotemporal graphs via new disentangled deep generative models. Specifically, a new Bayesian model is proposed that factorizes spatiotemporal graphs into spatial, temporal, and graph factors as well as the factors that explain the interplay among them. A variational objective function and new mutual information thresholding algorithms driven by information bottleneck theory have been proposed to maximize the disentanglement among the factors with theoretical guarantees. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-arts by up to 69.2% for graph generation and 41.5% for interpretability.",

            "title": "Summarizing Source Code from Structure and Context",
            "abstract": "Modern software developers tend to engage in social coding platforms to reuse code snippets to expedite the development process, while the codes on such platforms are often suffering from comments being mismatched, missing or outdated. This puts the code search and comprehension in difficulty, and increases the burden of maintenance for software building upon these codes. As summarizing code is beneficial yet it is very expensive for manual operation, in this paper, we elaborate an automatic and effective code summarization paradigm to address this laborious challenge. We represent a given code snippet as an abstract syntax tree (AST), and generate a set of compositional root-to-leaf paths to make the AST accessible regarding code context and structure in a less complex yet expressive way. Accordingly, we design a tree-based transformer model, called TreeXFMR, on these paths to summarize source code in a hierarchical attention operation. This yields two advantages on code representation learning: (1) attention mechanisms at token-and path-level attend the semantics and interactions of source code from different aspects; (2) bi-level positional encodings introduced reveal the intra- and inter-path structure of AST and improve the unambiguity of the representations. During decoding, TreeXFMR attends such learned representations to produce each output of natural language word. We further pre-train the transformer to achieve faster and better training convergence results. Extensive experiments on the code collection from GitHub demonstrate the effectiveness of TreeXFMR, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have drawn significant attentions over the years and been broadly applied to vital fields that require high security standard such as product recommendation and traffic forecasting. Under such scenarios, exploiting GNN's vulnerabilities and further downgrade its classification performance become highly incentive for adversaries. Previous attackers mainly focus on structural perturbations of existing graphs. Although they deliver promising results, the actual implementation needs capability of manipulating the graph connectivity, which is impractical in some circumstances. In this work, we study the possibility of injecting nodes to evade the victim GNN model, and unlike previous related works with white-box setting, we significantly restrict the amount of accessible knowledge and explore the black-box setting. Specifically, we model the node injection attack as a Markov decision process and propose GA2C, a graph reinforcement learning framework in the fashion of advantage actor critic, to generate realistic features for injected nodes and seamlessly merge them into the original graph following the same topology characteristics. Through our extensive experiments on multiple acknowledged benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GA2C over existing state-of-the-art methods.

The existing methods mainly rely on file content analysis while ignoring structured information among entities in social coding platforms.

To address these challenges, we develop Meta-AHIN, a novel model for COVID-19 themed malicious repository detection in GitHub. In Meta-AHIN, we first construct an attributed heterogeneous information network (AHIN) to model the code content and social coding properties in GitHub; and then we exploit attention-based graph convolutional neural network (AGCN) to learn repository embeddings and present a meta-learning framework for model optimization. To utilize unlabeled information in AHIN and to consider task influence of different types of repositories, we further incorporate node attribute-based self-supervised module and task-aware attention weight into AGCN and meta-learning respectively. Extensive experiments on the collected data from GitHub demonstrate that Meta-AHIN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "\n Differential privacy has been widely adopted to release continuous- and scalar-valued information on a database without compromising the privacy of individual data records in it. The problem of querying binary- and matrix-valued information on a database in a differentially private manner has rarely been studied. However, binary- and matrix-valued data are ubiquitous in real-world applications, whose privacy concerns may arise under a variety of circumstances. In this paper, we devise an exclusive or (XOR) mechanism that perturbs binary- and matrix-valued query result by conducting an XOR operation on the query result with calibrated noises attributed to a matrix-valued Bernoulli distribution. We first rigorously analyze the privacy and utility guarantee of the proposed XOR mechanism. Then, to generate the parameters in the matrix-valued Bernoulli distribution, we develop a heuristic approach to minimize the expected square query error rate under\n \u03f5\n -differential privacy constraint. Additionally, to address the intractability of calculating the probability density function (PDF) of this distribution and efficiently generate samples from it, we adapt an Exact Hamiltonian Monte Carlo based sampling scheme. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of the XOR mechanism by considering binary data classification and social network analysis, all in a differentially private manner. Experiment results show that the XOR mechanism notably outperforms other state-of-the-art differentially private methods in terms of utility (such as classification accuracy and\n F\n 1\n score), and even achieves comparable utility to the non-private mechanisms.\n",

To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose and develop an intelligent system named Dr.Droid to jointly model malware propagation and evolution for their detection at the first attempt. In Dr.Droid, we first exploit higher-level semantic and social relations within the ecosystem (e.g., app-market, app-developer, market-developer relations etc.) to characterize app propagation patterns; and then we present a structured heterogeneous graph to model the complex relations among different types of entities. To capture malware evolution, we further consider the temporal dependence and introduce a heterogeneous temporal graph to jointly model malware propagation and evolution by considering heterogeneous spatial dependencies with temporal dimensions. Afterwards, we propose a novel heterogeneous temporal graph transformer framework (denoted as HTGT) to integrate both spatial and temporal dependencies while preserving the heterogeneity to learn node representations for malware detection. Specifically, in our proposed HTGT, to preserve the heterogeneity, we devise a heterogeneous spatial transformer to derive heterogeneous attentions over each node and edge to learn dedicated representations for different types of entities and relations; to model temporal dependencies, we design a temporal transformer into the HTGT to attentively aggregate its historical sequences of a given node (e.g., app); the two transformers work in an iterative manner for representation learning. Promising experimental results based on the large-scale sample collections from anti-malware industry demonstrate the performance of Dr.Droid, by comparison with state-of-the-art baselines and popular mobile security products.",

            "title": "Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network",
            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been broadly studied on dynamic graphs for their representation learning, majority of which focus on graphs with homogeneous structures in the spatial domain. However, many real-world graphs - i.e., heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) - evolve dynamically in the context of heterogeneous graph structures. The dynamics associated with heterogeneity have posed new challenges for HTG representation learning. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose heterogeneous temporal graph neural network (HTGNN) to integrate both spatial and temporal dependencies while preserving the heterogeneity to learn node representations over HTGs. Specifically, in each layer of HTGNN, we propose a hierarchical aggregation mechanism, including intra-relation, inter-relation, and across-time aggregations, to jointly model heterogeneous spatial dependencies and temporal dimensions. To retain the heterogeneity, intra-relation aggregation is first performed over each slice of HTG to attentively aggregate information of neighbors with the same type of relation, and then intra-relation aggregation is exploited to gather information over different types of relations; to handle temporal dependencies, across-time aggregation is conducted to exchange information across different graph slices over the HTG. The proposed HTGNN is a holistic framework tailored heterogeneity with evolution in time and space for HTG representation learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on the HTGs built from different real-world datasets and promising results demonstrate the outstanding performance of HTGNN by comparison with state-of-the-art baselines. Our built HTGs and code have been made publicly accessible at: https://github.com/YesLab-Code/HTGNN.",

            "title": "Distilling Meta Knowledge on Heterogeneous Graph for Illicit Drug Trafficker Detection on Social Media",
            "abstract": "Driven by the considerable profits, the crime of drug trafficking (a.k.a. illicit drug trading) has co-evolved with modern technologies, e.g., social media such as Instagram has become a popular platform for marketing and selling illicit drugs. The activities of online drug trafficking are nimble and resilient, which call for novel techniques to effectively detect, disrupt, and dismantle illicit drug trades. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework named MetaHG to automatically detect illicit drug traffickers on social media (i.e., Instagram), by tackling the following two new challenges: (1) different from existing works which merely focus on analyzing post content, MetaHG is capable of jointly modeling multi-modal content and relational structured information on social media for illicit drug trafficker detection; (2) in addition, through the proposed meta-learning technique, MetaHG addresses the issue of requiring sufficient data for model training. More specifically, in our proposed MetaHG, we first build a heterogeneous graph (HG) to comprehensively characterize the complex ecosystem of drug trafficking on social media. Then, we employ a relation-based graph convolutional neural network to learn node (i.e., user) representations over the built HG, in which we introduce graph structure refinement to compensate the sparse connection among entities in the HG for more robust node representation learning. Afterwards, we propose a meta-learning algorithm for model optimization. A self-supervised module and a knowledge distillation module are further designed to exploit unlabeled data for improving the model. Extensive experiments based on the real-world data collected from Instagram demonstrate that the proposed MetaHG outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",
