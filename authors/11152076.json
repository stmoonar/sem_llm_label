            "abstract": "Intrusion detection is a form of anomalous activity detection in communication network traffic. Continual learning (CL) approaches to the intrusion detection task accumulate old knowledge while adapting to the latest threat knowledge. Previous works have shown the effectiveness of memory replay-based CL approaches for this task. In this work, we present two novel contributions to improve the performance of CL-based network intrusion detection in the context of class imbalance and scalability. First, we extend class balancing reservoir sampling (CBRS), a memory-based CL method, to address the problems of severe class imbalance for large datasets. Second, we propose a novel approach titled perturbation assistance for parameter approximation (PAPA) based on the Gaussian mixture model to reduce the number of virtual stochastic gradient descent (SGD) parameter computations needed to discover maximally interfering samples for CL. We demonstrate that the proposed approaches perform remarkably better than the baselines on standard intrusion detection benchmarks created over shorter periods (KDDCUP\u201999, NSL-KDD, CICIDS-2017/2018, UNSW-NB15, and CTU-13) and a longer period with distribution shift (AnoShift). We also validated proposed approaches on standard continual learning benchmarks (SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, and CLEAR-10/100) and anomaly detection benchmarks (SMAP, SMD, and MSL). Further, the proposed PAPA approach significantly lowers the number of virtual SGD update operations, thus resulting in training time savings in the range of 12 to 40% compared to the maximally interfered samples retrieval algorithm.",

Existing NFP solutions only focused on improving parallelism benefits without paying much attention to resource utilization while deploying VNFs of SFCs. We take advantage of resource-delay dependency to propose a flexible and efficient parallelized SFC placement mechanism called FlexSFC which determines the optimal SFC placement while reducing resource usage and meeting end-to-end delay guarantees of the SFCs deployed. Initial results show that FlexSFC guarantees the end-to-end delay requirement with better resource utilization and SFC acceptance rate than the state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "title": "Proactive Clustering of Base Stations in 5GC-RAN using Cellular Traffic Prediction",
            "abstract": "The rapid growth in mobile network traffic and dynamic user mobility patterns have propelled network operators toward the Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) to reduce operational costs and improve service quality. C-RAN handles the traffic and mobility issues in a centralized manner by segregating the central units (CUs) from the distributed units (DUs) in a shared CU pool. The ability of C-RAN to map multiple DUs to the same CU allows optimal coverage with high multiplexing gains, using the least number of CUs. However, dynamically mapping DUs to CUs is not trivial since the network traffic and mobility patterns are difficult to predict. This paper presents a two-phase framework for an optimal city-wide C-RAN network. In the first phase, we propose to use the ConvLSTM model, which simultaneously learns the hidden spatial and temporal dependencies in a real-world dataset and makes accurate traffic forecasts for a future duration of time. In the second phase, we use the predicted traffic from the first phase to develop a proactive optimal DU-CU clustering scheme that is cost-effective and meets quality objectives. We first formulate an optimization problem, and later, to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization, we propose a lightweight heuristic algorithm. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our prediction model and the mapping scheme using a two-month real-world mobile network dataset of Milan, Italy. Based on simulation results of phase one, we observe the ConvLSTM model, when deployed in a C-RAN architecture, outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction models with up to 26% better RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and up to 36% better MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) values. Similarly, in phase two, our simulation results show that compared to reactive threshold-based clustering, proactive clustering can reduce the average number of active CU servers by up to 18% every 10 minutes without overloading.",

            "abstract": "Many prior works investigated service function chain (SFC) placement in multi-core NFV servers with an assumption of treating all CPU cores equal. However, sophisticated servers follow non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture in which CPU cores are distributed across different NUMA nodes to enhance scalability. Our preliminary experiments show that placing VNFs in arbitrarily selected cores can degrade SFC performance, owing to contention for system resources at intra-node and inter-node levels. To handle the aforementioned problem, we study the impact of placing SFCs in a server by jointly considering the discrepancy of cores in different NUMA nodes and carefully allocating shared resources such as last level cache and memory bandwidth. We first propose a mathematical formulation, to optimally choose a node to place each SFC and allocate required shared system resources, in the form of a non-linear integer programming (NLIP) problem. Then we develop NUMASFP, a NUMA-aware dynamic SFC placement mechanism that places SFCs inside a server and migrates SFCs among NUMA nodes based on their current traffic rates to maximize the aggregate throughput of all SFCs. Furthermore, it ensures performance isolation for SFCs that are running inside the server. We evaluate the performance of NUMASFP by implementing it on a prototype system and also conducting large-scale simulation studies. The performance results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can effectively handle SFCs over state-of-the-art and baseline approaches.",

            "abstract": "To defend computing systems against ever-growing cyber attacks, Anomaly-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (A-NIDS) have to evolve continuously. This requirement renders classical machine learning algorithms ineffective since they do not handle sequentially evolving tasks gracefully. Specifically, neural networks (NNs) are prone to catastrophic forgetting (CF) when trained on sequential data. Recent advances in addressing this drawback of NNs have resulted in a paradigm called Continual Learning (CL) which mitigates CF by introducing suitable constraints during the sequential training of these NNs. CL has been shown to be very effective in improving the performance of NNs on computer vision tasks. However, its application to the design of A-NIDS has not been explored. In this work, we evaluate the suitability of CL to address the challenges posed in A-NIDS design. Unlike computer vision datasets, network datasets suffer from the Class Imbalance (CI) problem, which makes the direct application of CL algorithms challenging. To evaluate the suitability of CL algorithms on network datasets, we study the impact of class imbalance on task ordering and its effect on the design of CL- based A-NIDS in the Class Incremental (CIL) and Domain Incremental (DIL) learning settings. Towards this end, we apply two popular CL algorithms viz. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) on two datasets viz., CICIDS and KDD Cup'99, and evaluate their performance. We found that CI affects task order sensitivity to a greater extent in the CIL setting when compared to the DIL setting. The performance of DIL setting can be further enhanced by incorporating experience forgetting aware memory population techniques, and we recommend this as a practical approach to building CL-based A-NIDS.",
