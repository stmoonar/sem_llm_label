            "title": "Accelerating Polarization via Alphabet Extension",
            "abstract": "Polarization is an unprecedented coding technique in that it not only achieves channel capacity, but also does so at a faster speed of convergence than any other coding technique. This speed is measured by the ``scaling exponent'' and its importance is three-fold. Firstly, estimating the scaling exponent is challenging and demands a deeper understanding of the dynamics of communication channels. Secondly, scaling exponents serve as a benchmark for different variants of polar codes that helps us select the proper variant for real-life applications. Thirdly, the need to optimize for the scaling exponent sheds light on how to reinforce the design of polar codes. In this paper, we generalize the binary erasure channel (BEC), the simplest communication channel and the protagonist of many coding theory studies, to the ``tetrahedral erasure channel'' (TEC). We then invoke Mori--Tanaka's $2 \\times 2$ matrix over GF$(4)$ to construct polar codes over TEC. Our main contribution is showing that the dynamic of TECs converges to an almost--one-parameter family of channels, which then leads to an upper bound of $3.328$ on the scaling exponent. This is the first non-binary matrix whose scaling exponent is upper-bounded. It also polarizes BEC faster than all known binary matrices up to $23 \\times 23$ in size. Our result indicates that expanding the alphabet is a more effective and practical alternative to enlarging the matrix in order to achieve faster polarization.",

            "abstract": "Polar codes approach channel capacity provably and empirically and are thereby a constituent code of the 5G standard. Compared to low-density parity-check codes, however, the performance of short-length polar codes have rooms for improvement that could hinder its adoption by a wider class of applications. As part of the program that addresses the performance issue at short length, it is crucial to understand how fast binary memoryless symmetric channels polarize. A number, called scaling exponent, was defined to measure the speed of polarization and several estimates of the scaling exponent were given in literature. As of 2022, the tightest overestimate is 4.714 made by Mondelli, Hassani, and Urbanke in 2015. We lower the overestimate to 4.63. The idea behind this improvement is that, instead of describing the relation between a channel <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${W}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and its children <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${W}^ {\\scriptscriptstyle {\\boxed {\\star}}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${W}^ {\\bigcirc \\!\\!\\! \\star}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, we describe the relation between <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${W}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and its grandchildren <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ {W}^{\\scriptscriptstyle {\\boxed {\\star}} \\, {\\scriptscriptstyle {\\boxed {\\star}}} }$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${W}^{\\scriptscriptstyle {\\boxed {\\star}}\\, {{\\bigcirc \\!\\! \\star} }}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${W}^{{\\bigcirc \\!\\!\\! \\star}\\,\\,{\\scriptscriptstyle {\\boxed {\\star}}} }$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ {W}^{{\\bigcirc \\!\\!\\! \\star}\\,{\\bigcirc \\!\\!\\! \\star} }$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. By doing so, the evolution of channels becomes \u201cless Markovian\u201d and hence more tighter inequalities can be obtained.",

            "abstract": "With low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and polar codes selected as the standard codes for the fifth generation (5\u00a0G) enhanced Mobile Broad Band scenario (eMBB), a decoding architecture that can simultaneously support the decoding of control and data plane becomes necessary at the terminal side to meet the raising requirement for 5\u00a0G network deployment. Due to the special structure of LDPC codes according to the Release 15 (R15) 5\u00a0G standard, a straight-forward extension of the existing reconfigurable scheme is in general difficult. Therefore in this paper, a unified decoding architecture is proposed that can be reconfigured to either LDPC codes or polar codes. Due to various differences between the two codes such as parity-check matrices, codeword lengths and iterative methods, a joint decoding algorithm is introduced by reordering basic decoding operations to the unified add-comparison-add pattern for both codes. Then, a pipelined structure of reconfigurable decoding unit (RDU) is presented correspondingly which is fully compatible with all decoding patterns of the R15 standard. And finally, a reconfigurable decoder is proposed with multiple levels of parallelism, and the reconfiguration scheme is introduced to improve the hardware utilization and decoding efficiency. The proposed decoder is implemented in FPGA and ASIC, respectively, and has achieved state-of-the-art performance in throughput and area efficiency compared to LDPC-only and polar-only decoders.",

Up to 16 codes can be decoded in parallel and the utilization of processing units is no less than 87.5% for various codeword lengths.

Polar codes, as the channel coding scheme in the control plane of 5G eMBB scenario, still cannot satisfy the hardware implementation requirements of polar decoders for MU-MIMO systems. In this brief, a high throughput and low latency polar decoder is proposed for MU-MIMO systems. The decoding architecture is fully unfolded to maximize hardware parallelism, and is fully pipelined by decoupling the round-trip scheduling datapath to enable simultaneous processing of multiple codewords. Besides, a hybrid decoding datapath is introduced by proposing complementary decoding units with mixed data representations to reduce hardware complexity.
