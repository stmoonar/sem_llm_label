            "title": "USNAP: fast unique dense region detection and its application to lung cancer",
            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Many real-world problems can be modeled as annotated graphs. Scalable graph algorithms that extract actionable information from such data are in demand since these graphs are large, varying in topology, and have diverse node/edge annotations. When these graphs change over time they create dynamic graphs, and open the possibility to find patterns across different time points. In this article, we introduce a scalable algorithm that finds unique dense regions across time points in dynamic graphs. Such algorithms have applications in many different areas, including the biological, financial, and social domains. Results There are three important contributions to this manuscript. First, we designed a scalable algorithm, USNAP, to effectively identify dense subgraphs that are unique to a time stamp given a dynamic graph. Importantly, USNAP provides a lower bound of the density measure in each step of the greedy algorithm. Second, insights and understanding obtained from validating USNAP on real data show its effectiveness. While USNAP is domain independent, we applied it to four non-small cell lung cancer gene expression datasets. Stages in non-small cell lung cancer were modeled as dynamic graphs, and input to USNAP. Pathway enrichment analyses and comprehensive interpretations from literature show that USNAP identified biologically relevant mechanisms for different stages of cancer progression. Third, USNAP is scalable, and has a time complexity of O(m+mc\u2009log\u2009nc+nc\u2009log\u2009nc), where m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices in the dynamic graph; mc is the number of edges, and nc is the number of vertices in the collapsed graph. Availability and implementation The code of USNAP is available at https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/\u223cjuris/data/USNAP22.",

            "title": "SDREGION: Fast Spotting of Changing Communities in Biological Networks",
            "abstract": "Given a large, dynamic graph, how can we trace the activities of groups of vertices over time? Given a dynamic biological graph modeling a given disease progression, which genes interact closely at the early stage of the disease, and their interactions are being disrupted in the latter stage of the disease? Which genes interact sparsely at the early stage of the disease, and their interactions increase as the disease progresses? Knowing the answers to these questions is important as they give insights to the underlying molecular mechanism to disease progression, and potential treatments that target these mechanisms can be developed. There are three main contributions to this paper. First, we designed a novel algorithm, SDREGION, that identifies subgraphs that decrease or increase in density monotonically over time, referred to as d-regions or i-regions, respectively. We introduced the objective function, -density, for identifying d-(i-)regions. Second, SDREGION is a generic algorithm, applicable across several real datasets. In this manuscript, we showed its effectiveness, and made observations in the modeling of the progression of lung cancer. In particular, we observed that SDREGION identified d-(i-)regions that capture mechanisms that align with literature. Importantly, findings that were identified but were not retrospectively validated by literature may provide novel mechanisms in tumor progression that will guide future biological experiments. Third, SDREGION is scalable with a time complexity of O(mlogn + nlogn) where m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices in a given dynamic graph.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Network visualization tools offer features enabling a variety of analyses to satisfy diverse requirements. Considering complexity and diversity of data and tasks, there is no single best layout, no single best file format or visualization tool: one size does not fit all. One way to cope with these dynamics is to support multiple scenarios and workflows. NAViGaTOR (Network Analysis, Visualization & Graphing TORonto) offers a complete system to manage diverse workflows from one application. It allows users to manipulate large graphs interactively using an innovative graphical user interface (GUI) and through fast layout algorithms with a small memory footprint. NAViGaTOR facilitates integrative network analysis by supporting not only visualization but also visual data mining.",

            "abstract": "This paper develops a novel approach to combining probabilistic motion planners. Rather than trying to develop a single planner that works over a wide range of environments, we develop a strategy for combining different motion planners within a single framework. Specifically we examine how planners designed for open spaces and those designed for narrow passages can be integrated within a single planning framework. Information that is normally discarded in the planning process is used to identify regions as being potentially \u2018narrow\u2019 or \u2018cluttered\u2019, and we then apply the planner most suited for that region based on this information. Experimental results demonstrate our approach outperforms the basic PRM approach as well as a Gaussian sampler designed for narrow regions in three test environments.",
