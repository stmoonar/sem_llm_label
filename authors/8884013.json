            "abstract": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more pervasive in our society, it is crucial to develop, deploy, and assess Responsible and Trustworthy AI (RTAI) models, i.e., those that consider not only accuracy but also other aspects, such as explainability, fairness, and energy efficiency. Workflow provenance data have historically enabled critical capabilities towards RTAI. Provenance data derivation paths contribute to responsible workflows through transparency in tracking artifacts and resource consumption. Provenance data are well-known for their trustworthiness helping explainability, reproducibility, and accountability. However, there are complex challenges to achieve RTAI, which are further complicated by the heterogeneous infrastructure in the computing continuum (Edge-Cloud-HPC) used to develop and deploy models. As a result, a significant research and development gap remains between workflow provenance data management and RTAI. In this paper, we present a vision of the pivotal role of workflow provenance in supporting RTAI and discuss related challenges. We present a schematic view between RTAI and provenance, and highlight open research directions.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Modern large-scale scientific discovery requires multidisciplinary collaboration across diverse computing facilities, including High Performance Computing (HPC) machines and the Edge-to-Cloud continuum. Integrated data analysis plays a crucial role in scientific discovery, especially in the current AI era, by enabling Responsible AI development, FAIR, Reproducibility, and User Steering. However, the heterogeneous nature of science poses challenges such as dealing with multiple supporting tools, cross-facility environments, and efficient HPC execution. Building on data observability, adapter system design, and provenance, we propose MIDA: an approach for lightweight runtime Multi-workflow Integrated Data Analysis. MIDA defines data observability strategies and adaptability methods for various parallel systems and machine learning tools. With observability, it intercepts the dataflows in the background without requiring instrumentation while integrating domain, provenance, and telemetry data at runtime into a unified database ready for user steering queries. We conduct experiments showing end-to-end multi-workflow analysis integrating data from Dask and MLFlow in a real distributed deep learning use case for materials science that runs on multiple environments with up to 276 GPUs in parallel. We show near-zero overhead running up to 100,000 tasks on 1,680 CPU cores on the Summit supercomputer.",

            "title": "Can Automated Metadata Extraction Make Scientific Data More Navigable?",
            "abstract": "FAIR principles require that scientific data be findable, discoverable, and reusable by users. To enable FAIRness, practioners of a science repository will often construct a rich, searchable index of metadata derived from the data. Unfortunately, manual metadata annotation methods do not scale to the many data files generated by many projects; and instead automated extraction systems are needed to scalably parse these files\u2014often with nonstandard schema requiring specialized parsing strategies\u2014and deposit representative metadata into a search index. In this work, we evaluate whether, and the extent to which, automatically extracted metadata make research repositories more navigable. We present a two-part user study conducted with scientists at two U.S. national laboratories from projects spanning spectroscopy and battery modeling. We constructed research indexes automatically by using the Xtract metadata extraction system. In the first part of our study, we learned about each user's role and identified key navigation concerns for scientists. We found that participants wished to navigate for purposes of discovery, retrieval, and organization. In the second part, participants completed simulated research data navigation tasks crafted to reflect real-world navigability concerns. We found that regardless of the interface used, participants consistently solved navigation tasks with high degrees of confidence and correctness, and significantly ($1.2\\mathrm{X}-50\\times$) faster than via their alternative methods (e.g., manual directory scans or designing a customized navigational tool).",

            "abstract": "Proper application of the FAIR data principles is what separates a vibrant data ecosystem, in which research data are frequently shared and reused, from a lifeless data graveyard. Automated metadata extraction systems have been proposed as a means of bolstering the findability, interoperability, and reusability of data repositories with little or no human intervention. These extraction systems mine metadata by crawling a repository and applying lightweight extractors that, for various types of file (e.g., image, CSV file), extract or synthesize relevant attributes. In practice, however, the automated creation of generally useful metadata is fraught with challenges. Data consumers may have different perspectives as to what metadata representations are useful, the standards for recording metadata tend to change over time, and the software model for processing updates can introduce unnecessary human and computational effort. Thus, generalizing extraction for a broad audience of data consumers is a difficult and relatively unsolved problem. In this work, we explore these challenges faced by extraction systems in the context of constructing our own extraction system for science data. We first define the metadata extraction problem and provide context to the issues faced in generalizing metadata. Additionally, we identify potential research directions to help alleviate many of these challenges for all automated extraction systems. Ultimately, this work represents a first step in designing Ubiquitous metadata extraction systems that can maximize the value of research data while minimizing the human efforts required in doing so.",

            "abstract": "The analysis of vast amounts of data and the processing of complex computational jobs have traditionally relied upon high performance computing (HPC) systems, which offer reliable and efficient management of large-scale computational and data resources. Understanding these analyses\u2019 needs is paramount for designing solutions that can lead to better science, and similarly, understanding the characteristics of the user behavior on those systems is important for improving user experiences on HPC systems. A common approach to gathering data about user behavior is to extract workload characteristics from system log data available only to system administrators. Recently at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), however, we unveiled user behavior about the Summit supercomputer by collecting data from a user\u2019s point of view with ordinary Unix commands.In this paper, we discuss the process, challenges, and lessons learned while preparing this dataset for publication and submission to an open data challenge. The original dataset contains personal identifiable information (PII) about the users of OLCF which needed be masked prior to publication, and we determined that anonymization, which scrubs PII completely, destroyed too much of the structure of the data to be interesting for the data challenge. We instead chose to pseudonymize the dataset, which reduced the linkability of the dataset to the users\u2019 identities. Pseudonymization is significantly more computationally expensive than anonymization, and the size of our dataset, which is approximately 175 million lines of raw text, necessitated the development of a parallelized workflow that could be reused on different HPC machines. We demonstrate the scaling behavior of the workflow on two leadership class HPC systems at OLCF, and we show that we were able to bring the overall makespan time from an impractical 20+ hours on a single node down to around 2 hours. As a result of this work, we release the entire pseudonymized dataset and make the workflows and source code publicly available.",

            "abstract": "We introduce Xtract, an automated and scalable system for bulk metadata extraction from large, distributed research data repositories. Xtract orchestrates the application of metadata extractors to groups of files, determining which extractors to apply to each file and, for each extractor and file, where to execute. A hybrid computing model, built on the funcX federated FaaS platform, enables Xtract to balance tradeoffs between extraction time and data transfer costs by dispatching each extraction task to the most appropriate location. Experiments on a range of clouds and supercomputers show that Xtract can efficiently process multi-million-file repositories by orchestrating the concurrent execution of container-based extractors on thousands of nodes. We highlight the flexibility of Xtract by applying it to a large, semi-curated scientific data repository and to an uncurated scientific Google Drive repository. We show that by remotely orchestrating metadata extraction across decentralized storage and compute nodes, Xtract can process large repositories in 50% of the time it takes just to transfer the same data to a machine within the same computing facility. We also show that when transferring data is necessary (e.g., no local compute is available), Xtract can scale to process files as fast as they are received, even over a multi-GB/s network.",

            "abstract": "Exploding data volumes and velocities, new computational methods and platforms, and ubiquitous connectivity demand new approaches to computation in the sciences. These new approaches must enable computation to be mobile, so that, for example, it can occur near data, be triggered by events (e.g., arrival of new data), be offloaded to specialized accelerators, or run remotely where resources are available. They also require new design approaches in which monolithic applications can be decomposed into smaller components, that may in turn be executed separately and on the most suitable resources. To address these needs we present funcX---a distributed function as a service (FaaS) platform that enables flexible, scalable, and high performance remote function execution. funcX's endpoint software can transform existing clouds, clusters, and supercomputers into function serving systems, while funcX's cloud-hosted service provides transparent, secure, and reliable function execution across a federated ecosystem of endpoints. We motivate the need for funcX with several scientific case studies, present our prototype design and implementation, show optimizations that deliver throughput in excess of 1 million functions per second, and demonstrate, via experiments on two supercomputers, that funcX can scale to more than more than 130 000 concurrent workers.",
