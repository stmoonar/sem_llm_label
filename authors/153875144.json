            "title": "Privacy Policies and Consent Management Platforms: Growth and Users' Interactions over Time",
            "abstract": "In response to growing concerns about user privacy, legislators have introduced new regulations and laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) that force websites to obtain user consent before activating personal data collection, fundamental to providing targeted advertising. The cornerstone of this consent-seeking process involves the use of Privacy Banners, the technical mechanism to collect users' approval for data collection practices. Consent management platforms (CMPs) have emerged as practical solutions to make it easier for website administrators to properly manage consent, allowing them to outsource the complexities of managing user consent and activating advertising features. This paper presents a detailed and longitudinal analysis of the evolution of CMPs spanning nine years. We take a twofold perspective: Firstly, thanks to the HTTP Archive dataset, we provide insights into the growth, market share, and geographical spread of CMPs. Noteworthy observations include the substantial impact of GDPR on the proliferation of CMPs in Europe. Secondly, we analyse millions of user interactions with a medium-sized CMP present in thousands of websites worldwide. We observe how even small changes in the design of Privacy Banners have a critical impact on the user's giving or denying their consent to data collection. For instance, over 60% of users do not consent when offered a simple\"one-click reject-all\"option. Conversely, when opting out requires more than one click, about 90% of users prefer to simply give their consent. The main objective is in fact to eliminate the annoying privacy banner rather the make an informed decision. Curiously, we observe iOS users exhibit a higher tendency to accept cookies compared to Android users, possibly indicating greater confidence in the privacy offered by Apple devices.",

            "abstract": "Emotional reactions to Online Social Network posts have recently gained importance in the study of the online ecosystem. Prior to post publication, the number of received reactions can be predicted based on either the textual content of the post or the related metadata. However, existing approaches suffer from both the lack of semantic-aware language understanding models and the limited explainability of the prediction models. To overcome these issues, we present a new transformer-based method to predict the number of emotional reactions of different types to social posts. It leverages the attention mechanism to capture arbitrary semantic textual relations neglected by prior works. Furthermore, it also provides end-users with textual explanations of the predictions. The results achieved on a large collection of Facebook posts confirm the applicability of the presented methodology.",

            "abstract": "Welcome to the second ACM DATA ECONOMY WORKSHOP (DEC), co-located with ACM SIGCMOD 2023. Data-driven decision making through machine learning algorithms (ML) is transforming the way society and the economy work and is having a profound positive impact on our daily lives. With the exception of very large companies that have both the data and the capabilities to develop powerful ML-driven services, the vast majority of demonstrably possible ML services, from e-health to transportation to predictive maintenance, to name a few, still remain at the level of ideas or prototypes for the simple reason that data, the capabilities to manipulate it, and the business models to bring it to market rarely exist under one roof. Data must somehow meet the ML and business skills that can unleash its full power for society and the economy. This has given rise to an extremely dynamic sector around the Data Economy, involving Data Providers/Controllers, data Intermediaries, often-times in the form of Data Marketplaces or Personal Information Management Systems for end users to control and even monetize their personal data. Despite its enormous potential and observed initial growth, the Data Economy is still in its early stages and therefore faces a still uncertain future and a number of existential challenges. These challenges include a wide range of technical issues that affect multiple disciplines of computer science, including networks and distributed systems, security and privacy, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. The mission of the ACM DEC workshop will be to bring together all CS capabilities needed to support the Data Economy. We would like to thank the entire technical program committee for reviewing and selecting papers for the workshop. We hope you will find the papers interesting and stimulating.",

            "abstract": "Web tracking through third-party cookies is considered a threat to users' privacy and is supposed to be abandoned in the near future. Recently, Google proposed the Topics API framework as a privacy-friendly alternative for behavioural advertising. Using this approach, the browser builds a user profile based on navigation history, which advertisers can access. The Topics API has the possibility of becoming the new standard for behavioural advertising, thus it is necessary to fully understand its operation and find possible limitations. This paper evaluates the robustness of the Topics API to a re-identification attack where an attacker reconstructs the user profile by accumulating user's exposed topics over time to later re-identify the same user on a different website. Using real traffic traces and realistic population models, we find that the Topics API mitigates but cannot prevent re-identification to take place, as there is a sizeable chance that a user's profile is unique within a website's audience. Consequently, the probability of correct re-identification can reach 15-17%, considering a pool of 1,000 users. We offer the code and data we use in this work to stimulate further studies and the tuning of the Topic API parameters.",

            "abstract": "URLs play an essential role on the Internet, allowing access to Web resources. Automatically generating URLs is helpful in various tasks, such as application debugging, API testing, and blocklist creation for security applications. Current testing suites deeply embed experts\u2019 domain knowledge to generate suitable URLs, resulting in an ad-hoc solution for each given application. These tools thus require heavy manual intervention, with the expensive coding of rules that are hard to maintain. We here introduce URLGEN, a system that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to tackle the automatic URL generation problem. URLGEN is designed for Web API testing and generates URL samples for an application without any system expertise, complementing the existing tools. It leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, augmented by an embedding layer that simplifies the URL learning and generation process. We show that URLGEN learns to generate new valid URLs from samples of real URLs without requiring any domain knowledge and following a purely data-driven approach. We compare the GAN architecture of URLGEN against other design options and show that the LSTM architecture can better capture the correlation among URL characters, outperforming previously proposed solutions. Finally, we show that the URLGEN approach can be extended to other scenarios, which we illustrate with two use cases, i.e., cybersquatting domain prediction and URL classification.",

            "abstract": "Privacy Banners are a common experience while surfing the Web. Mandated by privacy regulations, they are the way for users to express their consent to the usage of cookies and data collection. They take various forms, carry different wordings and offer different interaction mechanisms. While several works have qualitatively evaluated the effectiveness of privacy banners, it is still unclear how users take advantage of the options offered and if and how the design of the banner could influence their choice. This work presents a large-scale analysis of how the Privacy Banner options impact on users' interaction with it. We use data from a global Consent Management Platform serving more than 400 websites with visitors from all countries. With this, we observe more than 4M interactions collected over three months. We find that only 1\u20134% of visitors opt out of cookies when more than one click is required. Conversely, when offered a Reject All button to deny consent with a single click, the percentage of users who deny consent increases to about 21%. We further investigate other properties, such as the visitor's country, device type, banner position, etc. While the results confirm some common beliefs, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to accurately quantify how people interact with Privacy Banners and observe the effect of offering a single-click refusal option. We believe our work improves the understanding of user behaviour and perception of privacy, as well as the implications and effectiveness of privacy regulations.",

            "abstract": "Payment platforms have significantly evolved in recent years to keep pace with the proliferation of online and cashless payments. These platforms are increasingly aligned with online social networks, allowing users to interact with each other and transfer small amounts of money in a Peer-to-Peer fashion. This poses new challenges for analysing payment data, as traditional methods are only user-centric or business-centric and neglect the network users build during the interaction. This paper proposes a first methodology for measuring user value in modern payment platforms. We combine quantitative user- centric metrics with an analysis of the graph created by users' activities and its topological features inspired by the evolution of opinions in social networks. We showcase our approach using a dataset from a large operational payment platform and show how it can support business decisions and marketing campaign design, e.g., by targeting specific users.",

Studying these phenomena provides an understanding of the OSN landscape and requires appropriate methods. This paper presents a methodology to discover notable posts and group them according to their related topic. By combining anomaly detection, graph modelling and community detection techniques, we pinpoint salient events automatically, with the ability to tune the amount of them. We showcase our approach using a large Instagram dataset and extract some notable weekly topics that gained momentum from 1.4 million posts.

            "abstract": "With new Low Earth Orbit satellite constellations such as Starlink, satellite-based Internet access is becoming an alternative to traditional fixed and wireless technologies with comparable throughputs and latencies. In this paper, we investigate the user-perceived performance of Starlink. Our measurements show that latency remains low and does not vary significantly under idle or lightly loaded links. Compared to another commercial Internet access using a geostationary satellite, Starlink achieves higher TCP throughput and provides faster web browsing. To avoid interference from performance enhancing proxies commonly used in satellite networks, we also use QUIC to assess performance under load and packet loss. Our results indicate that delay and packet loss increase slightly under load for both upload and download.",
