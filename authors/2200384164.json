            "abstract": "Our project has a very simple aim which is to solve our daily problems which include transferring photos and different media from our phone storage to external storage. which is why we chose to work on - \"transferring phone gallary data to the cloud to reduce load on device's memory\". They are nice portable devices used for communicating but with advancement in phone technology things have taken a turn since we first used a Nokia back in 2001. People communicate and share content with each other via phones .now where does this content go ? right, in our phone's memory but what happens when you run out of space ? right, you use an external memory facility but what's next when the card is full and you don't have the luxury of a laptop around you and you just can't delete all the data you have in the name of memories . I am so glad to tell you that we have a solution .you don't need to worry about the space that is taken by your media. We intend to link this data sends to the cloud .",

            "title": "File Transfer Using Secure Sockets in Linux Environment",
            "abstract": "File transfer over a network is done in various ways and using different protocols. But a file transferred over a network is not secure. When the network architecture consists of hubs or is wireless then the packets are broadcasted to every computer on that network. In hubs these packets are broadcasted because a hub does not remember what all devices are attached to it. It just takes a packet and sends it on all its ports. Similarly in wireless networks the data packets are broadcasted. In normal circumstances, the computer devices which are supposed to get the file receive it and the other computers reject it. Now, the problem arises when a computer\u2019s system is cracked and that computer starts accepting the data it is not supposed to accept. This is the case with packet sniffing. The files sent during a transaction may be captured or \u201csniffed\u201d by third party tools called \u201cSniffers\u201d. If a sniffer is placed in promiscuous mode, then it can capture all the incoming datagrams and it can reconstruct the original file from those datagrams. To ensure privacy and security we will implement file transfer over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) so that the file is not interpreted by a sniffer. SSL is a communications protocol layer. It intercepts traffic and provides security between client and the server. Encryption is used to guarantee secure communication in an insecure environment. The encryption/decryption algorithm used for the purpose is Caesar Cipher. First, a file transfer program will be developed using socket programming under Linux environment and then security will be implemented using the above encryption/decryption algorithm.",
