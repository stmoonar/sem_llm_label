            "abstract": "Software developers can choose among many popular widget toolkits to build graphical user interfaces quickly. Widgets like sliders, buttons and scrollbars are widespread and well-understood by the public. They allow users to interact with the software, to trigger operations or to set parameters. It is also recognized that widgets could be enhanced to provide a better user experience. Embedded visualizations, also known as scents, could be added to standard widgets to enhance their capabilities. In this work, we survey the literature concerning scented widgets. We propose a two-level taxonomy structured around four main dimensions: Purpose, Widget Type, Number of Scents and Scent Type, with examples of scented widgets. We also discuss our current thoughts about the scope of this survey, and call for feedback to further improve and extend the proposed taxonomy.",

            "abstract": "Although node-link representations of graphs are widespread and even sometimes preferred to other approaches, they suffer from obvious limitations when graphs become large or dense, inducing visual cluttering and impeding the traditional visual information seeking process. This article presents a new strategy of exploration particularly suitable when graphs are large and dense. Users iteratively drive the exploration through the visualization of small sub-networks of interest. Our technique is particularly useful with multilayer networks, where layers typically combine into a large and dense network. Our iterative exploration process called M-QuBE 3 computes a score for each node of a graph based on structural and semantic information where more interesting nodes from a user point of view have higher scores. This in turn translates into a procedure to select sub-networks of interest. Within each sub-network, the user can select nodes to enhance the semantic context (and thus impact their interest score) and iteratively refine the exploration towards more relevant sub-networks. The M-QuBE 3 process natively handles multilayer network and allows the use of layers as a semantic apparatus when driving the navigation.",

            "abstract": "This report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 19061 \"Visual Analytics of Multilayer Networks Across Disciplines\". \n \nNetworks, used to understand systems, often contain multiple types of nodes and/or edges. They are often flattened to a single network, even though real-world systems are more accurately modelled as a set of interacting networks, or layers, with different node and edge types. \nThese are so-called multilayer networks. These networks are studied by researchers both in network visualization and in complex systems -- the domain from which the concept of multilayer networks has recently emerged. \nMoreover, researchers in various application domains study these systems, e.g. biology, digital humanities, sociology and journalism. \nThese research areas have shown parallel individual developments. Therefore, one of the aims of the seminar was to bring together an interdisciplinary community of researchers and practitioners of different disciplines. \nThis interdisciplinary community discussed existing solutions, open challenges and future research directions for visual analytics of multilayer networks across disciplines. \n \nThe seminar was attended by researchers from information visualization, visual analytics, complex systems and application domains. The application domains covered digital humanities, social sciences, biological sciences, and in public health research (25% of attendees were from these fields). The seminar not only provided multiple application domains for the visualization experts, but also also provided the domains experts with different groups of visualization experts in breakouts sessions, to expose them to multiple approaches to solving their problems. Building on this close working relationship between the visualization and domain experts, working groups were defined to determine which are the important challenges for multilayer network visualization. A number of sub-topics were identified that require further research: A unifying visualization framework, Novel Visual Encodings, Analytic and Attributes, Interaction, Evaluation, Use Cases and Human Factors. The outcomes of the seminar should stimulate collaborative research on these topics between our community, complex networks, and wide range of application domains for the visual analytics of multilayer networks",

            "abstract": "Modelling relationship between entities in real\u2010world systems with a simple graph is a standard approach. However, reality is better embraced as several interdependent subsystems (or layers). Recently, the concept of a multilayer network model has emerged from the field of complex systems. This model can be applied to a wide range of real\u2010world data sets. Examples of multilayer networks can be found in the domains of life sciences, sociology, digital humanities and more. Within the domain of graph visualization, there are many systems which visualize data sets having many characteristics of multilayer graphs. This report provides a state of the art and a structured analysis of contemporary multilayer network visualization, not only for researchers in visualization, but also for those who aim to visualize multilayer networks in the domain of complex systems, as well as those developing systems across application domains. We have explored the visualization literature to survey visualization techniques suitable for multilayer graph visualization, as well as tools, tasks and analytic techniques from within application domains. This report also identifies the outstanding challenges for multilayer graph visualization and suggests future research directions for addressing them.",

This is helpful to analyze threads of topics over news archives (how stories unfold), or to monitor evolutions and development of social groups. Dynamic graph modeling is a powerful tool to capture these interactions over time, while visualization and finding communities still remain difficult, especially with a high density of links. We propose to extract the backbone of dynamic graphs in order to ease community detection and guide the exploration of trends evolution. Through the graph structure, we interactively coordinate node-link diagrams, Sankey diagrams, time series, and animations in order to extract patterns and follow community behavior. We illustrate our system with the exploration of the role of soccer in 6 years of TV/radio magazines in France, and the role of North Korea in about 10 years of Japanese news.",

Layers in a multilayer network bring nuances and must not be considered on an equal basis.

Text analysis of closed captions already brought us understanding of the spoken information. Today's advances in computer vision now enable us to look for relevant semantic information from the visual content of real-world archives. Combining these two levels of extracted information to make sense of an archive still remains a challenge. Multiplex net- works, which model multiple families of interactions in a graph, can capture and combine both sources of semantics. We can leverage on these objects to extract hierarchies and integrate them in an interactive heterogeneous \"visual cloud\". Inspired by word clouds, these clouds allow to grasp visual and textual semantic information captured from a multimedia collection all at once. The interaction then enables direct access to the relevant video. We demonstrate our system with the exploration of a Japanese news archive.",

            "abstract": "When analysing data and handling a visualisation, users mainly spend their cognitive resources making sense of the graph-ical representation and mapping it back to the data and domain. This task becomes even more critical when dealing with larger data sets. Therefore, a valuable visualisation design strategy is to couple graphical representations and user tasks to better support the sense making process. This paper focuses on a particular task where users must make sense of state changes occurring on nodes of a graph. To this end, we propose JASPER, a new layout algorithm focusing on the visualisation of nodes inspired from pixel-oriented layouts, relying on node clustering to identify and represent existing connections through spatial adjacency. JASPER can layout moderate size graphs in real-time and is able to tackle large graphs with up to 2 million nodes and 5 million edges in reasonable time (about half a minute). Furthermore, although JASPER has been designed around a specific application , the underlying methodology can be employed to draw quick overviews of any type of graphs. The paper lays down the underlying principles of JASPER, and reports it performances (execution times) on increasingly large graphs. JASPER is then used and showcased to visualise network propagation phenomenon in large graphs.",

            "abstract": "About a third of development projects fail to achieve satisfactory outcomes, according to agencies' independent evaluation units. To a large extent, these outcomes appear to be baked into projects at their inception due to inadequate project design or relevance. This prompts questions about the diffusion of project design concepts: To what extent are better-designed or better-performing projects more likely to be emulated? Do factors of bureaucratic or political attractiveness -- such as ease of set-up and rapidity of disbursement -- play a role? To address these questions, this paper explores the use of methods from network science. It constructs a network graph of the relationship among the components of all World Bank investment projects initiated from 1996 to 2014, based on the semantic similarity of the component descriptions. It uses the network to assess the characteristics of projects that are more 'prolific' in the sense of having closely related followers, and as tool for visualizing diffusion of design concepts. This illustrative exercise defines a measures of project 'influence' on subsequent projects and tests simple, nonexclusive hypotheses about the determinants of influence. It finds no significant impact of project outcome or quality of entry (as independently rated) on 'influence.' Nor does ease of project preparation (as proxied by time from concept note to effectiveness) have any significant effect. However, very small projects (less than $10 million) have markedly lower 'influence' on average. This finding may have implications for the usefulness of small projects as pilots for subsequent scale up.",

This makes the choice of an appropriate model in a given situation difficult. Selecting the most relevant model requires the ability to objectively compare them. This comparison can only be made at the cost of describing models based on a common formalism and yet independent from them. We propose to use graph rewriting to formally describe propagation mechanisms as local transformation rules applied according to a strategy. This approach makes sense when it is supported by a visual analytics framework dedicated to graph rewriting. The paper first presents our methodology to describe some propagation models as a graph rewriting problem. Then, we illustrate how our visual analytics framework allows to interactively manipulate models, and underline their differences based on measures computed on simulation traces.",

A core task in network analysis is to evaluate and understand group cohesion; that is, to explain why groups of elements belong together based on the underlying structure of the network. We present Detangler, a system that supports visual analysis of group cohesion in multiplex networks through dual linked views. These views feature new data abstractions derived from the original multiplex network: the substrate network and the catalyst network. We contribute two novel techniques that allow the user to analyze the complex structure of the multiplex network without the extreme visual clutter that would result from simply showing it directly. The harmonized layout visual encoding technique provides spatial stability between the substrate and catalyst views. The pivot brushing interaction technique supports linked highlighting between the views based on computations in the underlying multiplex network to leapfrog between subsets of catalysts and substrates. We present results from the motivating application domain of annotated news documents with a usage scenario and preliminary expert feedback. A second usage scenario presents group cohesion analysis of the social network of the early American independence movement.",

            "abstract": "Modeling propagation dynamics on networks is an amazingly fertile and active area of research. Roughly speaking, network models aim at gaining a better understanding of how actors influence the overall network behaviour through their individual actions. However, considering the extended literature surrounding the subject, one is entitled to think that moving beyond the state-of-the-art in network modeling requires the ability to compare models, or consider slight variations of a model. This requires having a common language describing all considered models, allowing to objectively compare them and unfold their inherent properties and complexity. This also assumes users can easily run models, steer them and interactively evaluate their performance and behaviour. The approach we describe aims at providing a framework turning network propagation modeling into rule-based modeling (aka graph rewriting). That is, models are described as a set of algorithmic transformation rules acting locally. Our approach has partially been validated by providing such a description of a well-known model relying on probabilistic rules, where nodes trigger actions depending on their neighbor's influences. The results so obtained confirm rule-based modeling as a promising avenue. The use of a visual analytics framework to conduct such tasks is vital and motivated us to further develop and adapt a general purpose visual analytics system for graph rewriting to the particular case of network propagation.",

            "abstract": "Software designs are ever changing to adapt to new environments and requirements. Tracking and understanding changes in modules and relationships in a software project is difficult, but even more so when the software goes through several types of changes. The typical complexity and size of software also makes it harder to grasp software evolution patterns. In this paper, we present an interactive matrix-based visualization technique that, combined with animation, depicts how software designs evolve. For example, it shows which new modules and couplings are added and removed over time. Our generic visualization supports dynamic and weighted digraphs and is applied in the context of software evolution. Analyzing source code changes is important to determine the software's structural organization and identify quality issues over time. To demonstrate our approach, we explore open-source repositories and discuss some of our findings regarding these evolving software designs.",

            "abstract": "Modeling propagation dynamics on networks is an amazingly fertile and active area of research. Roughly speaking, network models aim at gaining a better understanding of how actors influence the overall network behavior through their individual actions. Models typically consist in specifying a finite number of algorithmic rules from which overall structural trends can be derived. One is entitled to think that moving beyond the state-of-the-art in network modeling requires the ability to compare models, not only looking at their performance and suitability, but at a fundamental level. This ambitious goal requires having a common language describing models, allowing to objectively compare them and unfold their inherent properties and complexity. The results we present aim at providing a common framework turning network propagation modeling into rule-based modeling (aka graph rewriting). That is, models are described as a set of algorithmic rules acting locally. We show the validity of our approach by providing a description of the well-known model proposed by Goyal et al. 2010 relying on probabilistic rules, where nodes trigger actions depending on their neighbor's influences. Rule-based modeling not only provides a common language to define, describe and build models. It also paves the road to a formal setting from which model simulations can be steered. Because the application of rules is stochastic and non-deterministic, different variations of a model can be defined and easily compared. Our approach is moreover supported through the visual framework PORGY, turning model validation and comparison into a game where one iterates transformation rules on an initial graph, until some condition is met. The results we have obtained using Goyal's model confirm rule-based modeling as a promising avenue. Extending its application to other models will show its use as a common, if not universal, formal language to define and describe network propagation models.",

            "title": "Assessing group cohesion in homophily networks",
            "abstract": "The analysis and exploration of a social network depends on the type of relations at play. Borgatti had proposed a type taxonomy organizing relations in four possible categories. Homophily (similarity) relationships form an important category where relations occur when entities of the network link whenever they exhibit similar behaviors. Examples are networks of co-author, where homophily between two persons follows from co-authorship; or network of actors having played under the supervision of the same movie director, for instance. Homophily is often embodied through a bipartite network where entities of a given type A (authors, movie directors) connect through entities of a different type \u212c (papers, actors). A common strategy is then to project this bipartite graph onto a single-type network with entities of a same type A, possibly weighting edges based on how the type A entities interact with the type \u212c entities underlying the edge. The resulting single-type network can then be studied using standard techniques such as community detection using edge density, or the computation of various centrality indices. This paper revisits this type of approach and introduces a homogeneity measure inspired form past work by Burt. Two entities of type \u212c interact when they both induce a same edge between two entities of type A. The homogeneity of a subgroup thus depends on how intensely and how equally interactions occur between entities of type \u212c giving rise to the subgroup. The measure thus differentiates between subgroups of type A exhibiting similar topologies depending on the interaction patterns of the underlying entities of type \u212c. The method is validated using two widely used datasets. A first example looks at authors of the IEEE InfoVis Conference (InfoVis 2007 Contest). A second example looks at homophily relations between movie actors that have played under the direction of a same director (IMDB).",

Moreover the emergence of scale free and small world properties in real world networks has stimulated lots of activity in the field of network analysis and data mining. Clustering remains a fundamental technique to explore and organize these networks. A challenging problem is to find a clustering algorithm that works well in terms of clustering quality and is efficient in terms of time complexity. In this paper, we propose a fast clustering algorithm which combines some heuristics with a Topological Decomposition to obtain a clustering. The algorithm which we call Topological Decomposition and Heuristics for Clustering (TDHC) is highly efficient in terms of asymptotic time complexity as compared to other existing algorithms in the literature. We also introduce a number of Heuristics to complement the clustering algorithm which increases the speed of the clustering process maintaining the high quality of clustering. We show the effectiveness of the proposed clustering method on different real world data sets and compare its results with well known clustering algorithms.",

They can be seen as a game where one iterates transformation rules on an initial graph, until some condition is met. A rule describes a local pattern (i.e. a subgraph) that must be identified in a graph and specifies how to transform this subgraph. The graph rewriting formalism is at the same time extremely rich and complex, making the study of a model expressed in terms of graph rewriting quite challenging. For instance, predicting whether rules can be applied in any order is often difficult. When modelling complex systems, graphical formalisms have clear advantages: they are more intuitive and make it easier to visualize a system and convey intuitions about it. This work focuses on the design of an interactive visual graph rewriting system which supports graphical manipulations and computation to reason and simulate on a system. PORGY has been designed based on regular exchanges with graph rewriting systems experts and users over the past three years. The design choices relied on a careful methodology inspired from Munzner's nested process model for visualization design and validation [4].",

Edge bundling, as well as other edge clustering approaches relying on the use of high quality edge rerouting. Typical approach for drawing edge-bundled graph is to render edges as curves. But curves generation can have a relatively high computational costs and do not easily comply with real-time interaction. Furthermore, while edge bundling provides a much better overall readability of a graph, the bundles make it more difficult to recover local information. Our goal was thus to provide fluid interaction allowing the recovery of local information through specific interaction techniques. The system we built offers folklore or classical interaction such as zoom & pan, fish-eye and magnifying lens. We also implemented the Bring & Go technique by Tominski et al. We proposed an approach exploiting the full computing power of GPU's when rendering graph edges as parametric splines. The gain in efficiency when running all curves computations on the GPU turns bundling techniques into techniques that can be embedded in interactive systems concerned with graphs of several thousands of nodes and edges.",

The classical methods present search results as an ordered list of web pages ranked in terms of relevance to the searched topic. Users thus have to scan text snippets or navigate through various pages before finding the required information. In this paper we present an interactive visualization system for content analysis of web search results. The system combines a number of algorithms to present a novel layout methodology which helps users to analyze and navigate through a collection of web pages. We have tested this system with a number of data sets and have found it very useful for the exploration of data. Different case studies are presented based on searching different topics on Wikipedia through Exalead's search engine.",

            "abstract": "R\u00e9sum\u00e9. The Graph Visualization Framework Tulip now enjoys 10 years of user experience, and has matured its architecture and development cycle. Originally designed to interactively navigate large graphs, the framework integrates state-of-the-art software engineering concepts and good practices. It offers a large panel of graphical representations (traditional graph drawing as well as alternate representations). Tulip is most useful in a data mining and knowledge discovery context, allowing users to easily add their own data analysis and computing routines through its plug-in architecture. Most research efforts in data mining and knowledge extraction and representation require experimentation and validation. To this end, our group develops the Tulip Graph Visualization Framework. Tulip offers a C++ plug-in mechanism easing the development and addition of new algorithms (computing graph statistics, graph drawing or graph clustering). This actually is a main feature of the Tulip platform. Tulip implements optimized and ef\ufb01cient data structures, data management and \ufb01ltering/inheritance mechanisms. Its rendering engine relies on OpenGL, while its GUI rests on Trollte-ch\u2019s QT library. The main interaction paradigm offered by Tulip is the computation and direct manipulation of graph hierarchies, making it unique among all available graph visualization platforms. Tulip can be used in a typical scenario where the goal is to discover trends in data. The exploration can be driven by the user using available plug-ins, computing statistics on a graph, designing colormaps or assigning sizes to nodes, for instance. Fig.",

Identifying Communities remains a fundamental technique to explore and organize these networks. Few metrics are widely used to discover the presence of communities in a network. We argue that these metrics do not truly reflect the presence of communities by presenting counter examples. This is because these metrics concentrate on local cohesiveness among nodes where the goal is to judge whether two nodes belong to the same community or vise versa. Thus loosing the overall perspective of the presence of communities in the entire network. In this paper, we propose a new metric to identify the presence of communities in real world networks. This metric is based on the topological decomposition of networks taking into account two important ingredients of real world networks, the degree distribution and the density of nodes. We show the effectiveness of the proposed metric by testing it on various real world data sets.",

An example of such a network comes from the field of Content Analysis (CA) and Text Mining where the goal is to analyze the contents of a set of web pages. The Network can be represented by the words appearing in the web pages as nodes and the edges representing a relation between two words if they appear in a document together. In this paper we present a CA system that helps users analyze these networks representing the textual contents of a set of web pages visually. Major contributions include a methodology to cluster complex networks based on duplication of nodes and identification of bridges i.e. words that might be of user interest but have a low frequency in the document corpus. We have tested this system with a number of data sets and users have found it very useful for the exploration of data. One of the case studies is presented in detail which is based on browsing a collection of web pages on Wikipedia.",

Intuitive layout equipped with basic Browsing an e-catalog through an interactive visual interface interaction makes the whole system suitable for a touch screen display. The system is currently being used in a public setting at the InnovaNews exhibit taking place at \" La cite des sciences \" in Paris (www.cite-sciences.fr and look for InnovaNews). visual interface The visualization is designed to browse through categorized data. Lower level information is organized into categories and sub-categories, a map showing links between categories helps users dig into more details. A network showing links between categories is initially displayed based on a force-directed layout. After a category has been selected, it moves towards the center of the screen. Neighbor categories are kept visible while all others fade away. Links are induced from items belonging to more than one category, in turn inducing links between (sub)-categories. Reduction of edge crossings follows a multi-circular sifting heuristic, somehow extending the greedy-switch algorithm to radial layout and improving over the two layer barycentric approach. InnovaNews also offers geographic map, a TreeMap and a timeline. GRAVITE is a joint INRIA, CNRS, and Universite de Bordeaux project.",

Most often, these metrics are turned into useful visual cues, or are used to interactively filter out parts of a graph while querying it, for instance. Along the years, analysts coming from different application domains have designed metrics to serve specific needs. Graph analytics, sometimes also called network science, recently developed as a cross-discipline field developing models shared by numerous application domains such as bio-informatics, social network analysis, web graphs, etc.[4] [10]. As a consequence, we end up finding various metrics in the literature aiming at similar goals; different names and analytics description often hide similarity between two metrics that originated from different fields. We survey a list of edge metrics for graphs and compare their relative value and behaviour, in an effort to organize them into a taxonomy and underline the genuine ingredients in each of them disregarding their origin.",

In doing so, hierarchical clustering not only contributes to the study of data but also brings in ingredients for interaction, enabling the user to zoom in and out of clusters while exploring the data in quest for evidence.",

Following the pixel-oriented paradigm [8], the key ingredients enabling the interactive navigation of extreme volumes of data rely on a set of functions bijectively mapping data elements to screen pixels. The use of the mapping from data elements to pixels constrain the computational complexity for the rendering process to be linear with respect to the number of rendered pixels on the screen as opposed to the dataset size. Our method furthermore allows the implementation of usual information visualization techniques such as zoom and pan, anamorphosis and texturing. As a proof-of-concept, we show how our technique can be adapted to interactively explore the Datacube, turning our approach into an efficient system for visual datamining. We report experiments conducted on a Datacube containing 50 millions of items. To our knowledge, our technique outperforms all existing ones and push the scalability limit close to the billion of elements. Supporting all basic navigation techniques, and being moreover flexible makes it easily reusable for a large number of applications.",

The technique combines two different visualizations emphasizing different points of view the user can adopt when analyzing the content of the hierarchy. Usual hierarchical (node-link) layout reflect the relative position of nodes in the hierarchy while a variation of a treemap emphasizes node attributes. The classical treemap algorithm has been adapted in order to deal with DAGs. Linking the two views enables the user to visually and interactively explore elements of the hierarchy with respect to selected attributes, while being able to locate the node in the DAG.",

The clusters themselves are sometimes terms \"communities\" and the way clusters relate to one another is often referred to as a \"community structure\". We study a modularity criterion MQ introduced by Mancoridis et al. in order to infer community structure on relational data. We prove a fundamental and useful property of the modularity measure MQ, showing that it can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution, making it a prevalent choice over less focused optimization criterion for graph clustering. This makes it possible to compare two different clusterings of a same graph as well as asserting the overall quality of a given clustering relying on the fact that MQ is Gaussian. Moreover, we introduce a generalization extending MQ to hierarchical clusterings of graphs which reduces to the original MQ when the hierarchy becomes flat",

We describe a metric that has been designed in order to identify the weakest edges in a small world network leading to an easy and low cost filtering procedure that breaks up a graph into smaller and highly connected components. We show how this metric can be exploited through an interactive navigation of the network based on semantic zooming.

In this research area, the various tasks to be conducted by biologists call for methods inspired from knowledge extraction and representation, and from information visualization. We describe a system devoted to the visualization of metabolic pathways. This set of biological reactions describe product transformations in the cell. The analysis of various pathway visualization tools led us to qualitative assertions. First, it is essential that the visualization environment preserves the drawing conventions borrowed from biology. Second, it seems important to offer an environment in which the user can navigate while preserving cognitive continuity. Our system focuses on these interactive and navigational issues. It offers mechanisms such as interactive color mapping and semantic zooming of pathways through various levels of details. Our tool also aims at helping biologists in the analysis of experimental results measuring gene expression in various biological processes. Although our efforts have focused on the visualization of metabolic pathways, our system should help to visualize, analyze and discover other types of biological pathways (e.g. regulatory pathways).",

            "abstract": "Two tasks in graph visualization require partitioning: the assignment of visual attributes and divisive clustering. Often, we would like to assign a color or other visual attributes to a node or edge that indicates an associated value. In an application involving divisive clustering, we would like to partition the graph into subsets of graph elements based on metric values in such a way that all subsets are evenly populated. Assuming a uniform distribution of metric values during either partitioning or coloring can have undesired effects such as empty clusters or only one level of emphasis for the entire graph. Probability density functions derived from statistics about a metric can help systems succeed at these tasks.",

            "abstract": "The problem of graph layout and drawing is fundamental to many approaches to the visualization of relational information structures. As the data set grows, the visualization problem is compounded by the need to reconcile the user\u2019s need for orientation cues with the danger of information overload. Put simply: How can we limit the number of visual elements on the screen so as not to overwhelm the user yet retain enough information that the user is able to navigate and explore the data set confidently? How can we provide orientational cues so that a user can understand the location of the current viewpoint in a large data set? These are problems inherent not only to graph drawing but information visualization in general. We propose a method which extracts the significant features of a directed acyclic graph as the basis for navigation 1.",

            "abstract": "When dealing with a graph, any visualization strategy must rely on a layout procedure at least to initiate the process. Because the visualization process evolves within an interactive environment the choice of this layout procedure is critical and will often be based on efficiency. This paper compares two popular layout strategies, one based on the extraction of a spanning tree, the other based on edge crossing minimization of directed acyclic graphs. The comparison is made based on a large number of experimental evidence gathered through random graph generation. The main conclusion of these experiments is that, contrary to the popular belief, usage of edge crossing minimization algorithms may be extremely useful and advantageous, even under the heavy requirements of information visualization.",

A second idea is that of \u201cfolding\u201d away subtrees that are too \u201cdifferent\u201d in some sense, thereby reducing the visual complexity of the tree.
