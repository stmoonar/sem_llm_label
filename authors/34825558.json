            "abstract": "The paper presents an intelligent spectrum sensing approach for next-generation wireless networks by exploiting deep learning, in which we develop a deep convolutional network (ConvNet) to automatically identify Fifth Generation New Radio (5G NR) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) signals under standards-specified channel models with diversified RF impairments. In particular, we design a semantic segmentation ConvNet to detect and localize the spectral content of 5G NR and LTE in a synthetic signal featured by spectrum occupancy. A received signal is first converted by a short-time Fourier transform and represented as a wideband spectrogram image which is then passed through the ConvNet, incorporated by DeepLabv3+ and ResNet18 to improve the accuracy of pixel-wise segmentation to further increase the accuracy of signal identification. In the simulations, our ConvNet achieves around 95% mean accuracy and 91% mean intersection-over-union (IoU) at medium SNR level and demonstrates robustness under various practical channel impairments.",

Particularly, we design a deep network, namely OFDM modulation classification network (OMCNet), with asymmetric depthwise separable convolution, residual connection, and attention mechanism in a sophisticated design of processing blocks to reduce the overall complexity without sacrificing learning efficiency. Relying on the simulations, our deep network achieves over 92% for different delay spread models demonstrates the robustness of modulation classification under various channel impairments. Remarkably, compared with a baseline model, OMCNet reduces the network size by four times and computation cost by two times with the asymmetric depthwise separable while achieving a competitive accuracy thanks to residual connection and attention mechanism.",

We explicitly concentrate on overloaded scenarios where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K + J > M$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K \\geq M$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. Our goal is to maximize the minimum throughput among all the IUs by optimizing the allocation of resources (including time, transmit beamforming at the AP, and reflect beamforming at the IRS), while guaranteeing the minimum amount of harvested energy at each EU. Towards this goal, we propose two user grouping (UG) schemes, namely, the non-overlapping UG scheme and the overlapping UG scheme, where the difference lies in whether identical IUs can exist in multiple groups. Different IU groups are served in orthogonal time dimensions, while the IUs in the same group are served simultaneously with all the EUs via spatial multiplexing. The two problems corresponding to the two UG schemes are mixed-integer non-convex optimization problems and difficult to solve optimally. We first provide a method to check the feasibility of these two problems, and then propose efficient algorithms for them based on the big-M formulation, the penalty method, the block coordinate descent, and the successive convex approximation. Simulation results show that: 1) the non-robust counterparts of the proposed robust designs are unsuitable for practical IRS-aided SWIPT systems with phase errors since the energy harvesting constraints cannot be satisfied; 2) the proposed UG strategies can significantly improve the max-min throughput over the benchmark schemes without UG or adopting random UG; 3) the overlapping UG scheme performs much better than its non-overlapping counterpart when the absolute difference between <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is small and the EH constraints are not stringent.",

A two-stage heuristic approach is proposed to reduce the number of inter-coordinated user equipment (UE) (UEs connected to multiple CPUs) in each CPU. Firstly, each UE connects to a master access point (AP) and a primary CPU; then, AP selection is executed. Secondly, each CPU performs a fine-tuning algorithm to drop the worst inter-coordinated UEs. Simulation results reveal that one can reduce inter-CPU coordination while yielding slight degradation in spectral efficiency and improving energy efficiency.",

Therefore, when millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication with its intrinsic Line-of-Sight (LoS) condition is adopted, accurate target localization is essential to determine the spatial relationship between the UAV and the grounded receivers (Rxs). In this article, a computer-vision (CV)-aided jointly optimization scheme of flight trajectory and power allocation is designed for mmWave UAV communication systems by utilizing the visual information captured via cameras equipped at the UAV. Compared with traditional schemes, the implementation cost and overhead can be greatly saved as no radio frequency transmissions are required in the proposed localization scheme. In addition, the transmit power at the UAV is jointly optimized with its flight trajectory in two different cases. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes.",

Our goal is to improve the communication system by allocating the IRS to assist one of the small-cells through a two-stage algorithm. In the first-stage, the algorithm selects which small-cell is assisted by the IRS. In the second stage, the phase shift of each IRS reflecting element and the beam-forming coefficients from each small-cell are computed. Unlike the majority of the solutions already proposed, the algorithm is designed to combine two distinct approaches. In the first stage, a data-driven reinforcement learning model is adopted to configure the general characteristics of each cell. While a traditional alternating optimization algorithm is adopted in the second stage to compute the coefficients associated with the IRS and small-cells. The performance of the two-stage algorithm is compared with three benchmark decision policies: random assignment, maximum capacity, and minimum capacity. Numerical results demonstrate the similarity between the communication system obtained through the proposed algorithm and the maximum capacity benchmark, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed solution to achieve a near-optimal capacity.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid emergence of advanced technologies for wireless communications, automatic modulation classification (AMC) has been deployed in the physical layer to blindly identify the modulation fashion of an incoming signal at the receiver and consequently improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization and management. Although recent works on AMC have adopted deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to deal with large-confusing signal data, they have shown to be vulnerable to channel deterioration by primitive architectures. In this letter, we design a high-performance CNN architecture, namely Residual-attention Convolutional Network (RanNet), that mainly involves multiple advanced processing blocks to learn intrinsic features of combined waveform data (including in-phase, quadrature, amplitude, and phase components). Each block incorporates attention connection and skip connection in a sophisticated-designed structure to strengthen relevant features and weaken irrelevant features while preventing the network from vanishing gradient. Simulation results on the RadioML 2018.01A dataset show that RanNet is robust to different channel impairments and outperforms state-of-the-art deep networks in terms of accuracy while having a reasonable complexity.",

            "title": "UAV Relayed Covert Wireless Networks: Expand Hiding Range via Drones",
            "abstract": "Covert communication has emerged as a revolutionary wireless technique to hide confidential information - either naturally or via artificial noise - from being detected. Random transmit power, time-variant channel state information, and location mobility can be leveraged to confuse the detection at the warden. However, it becomes challenging when the distance is long or the direct link is blocked. In this article, we explore an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the relay to assist covert wireless networks to achieve better quality of service. First, several typical application scenarios are demonstrated and briefly discussed. Then, two scenarios of UAVs serving as a relay in covert wireless networks are narrated. The first case investigates a multi-antenna transmitter aided by a drone relay in the long-range covert wireless network against the detection of a UAV warden. The second case studies the covert wireless network assisted by a UAV relay to overcome the channel blockage problem. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed schemes. Finally, some future challenges are discussed.",

            "abstract": "This letter proposes a novel dual-polarized rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. The proposed strategy transmits common and private symbols in parallel through dynamic polarization multiplexing, and it does not require successive interference cancellation (SIC) in the reception. For assisting the design of dual-polarized MIMO-RSMA systems, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) framework for predicting the ergodic sum-rates. An efficient DNN-aided adaptive power allocation policy is also developed for maximizing the ergodic sum-rates. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the DNNs for sum-rate prediction and power allocation and reveal that the dual-polarized MIMO-RSMA strategy can impressively outperform conventional baseline schemes.",
