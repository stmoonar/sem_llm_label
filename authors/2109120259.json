            "abstract": "Recently, molecular relational learning, whose goal is to predict the interaction behavior between molecular pairs, got a surge of interest in molecular sciences due to its wide range of applications. In this work, we propose CMRL that is robust to the distributional shift in molecular relational learning by detecting the core substructure that is causally related to chemical reactions. To do so, we first assume a causal relationship based on the domain knowledge of molecular sciences and construct a structural causal model (SCM) that reveals the relationship between variables. Based on the SCM, we introduce a novel conditional intervention framework whose intervention is conditioned on the paired molecule. With the conditional intervention framework, our model successfully learns from the causal substructure and alleviates the confounding effect of shortcut substructures that are spuriously correlated to chemical reactions. Extensive experiments on various tasks with real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMRL over state-of-the-art baseline models.",

            "title": "STERLING: Synergistic Representation Learning on Bipartite Graphs",
            "abstract": "A fundamental challenge of bipartite graph representation learning is how to extract informative node embeddings. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a promising paradigm to address this challenge. Most recent bipartite graph SSL methods are based on contrastive learning which learns embeddings by discriminating positive and negative node pairs. Contrastive learning usually requires a large number of negative node pairs, which could lead to computational burden and semantic errors. In this paper, we introduce a novel synergistic representation learning model (STERLING) to learn node embeddings without negative node pairs. STERLING preserves the unique local and global synergies in bipartite graphs. The local synergies are captured by maximizing the similarity of the inter-type and intra-type positive node pairs, and the global synergies are captured by maximizing the mutual information of co-clusters. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that STERLING could improve the connectivity between different node types in the embedding space. Extensive empirical evaluation on various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of STERLING for extracting node embeddings.",

            "abstract": "Unsupervised GAD methods assume the lack of anomaly labels, i.e., whether a node is anomalous or not. One common observation we made from previous unsupervised methods is that they not only assume the absence of such anomaly labels, but also the absence of class labels (the class a node belongs to used in a general node classification task). In this work, we study the utility of class labels for unsupervised GAD; in particular, how they enhance the detection of structural anomalies. To this end, we propose a Class Label-aware Graph Anomaly Detection framework (CLAD) that utilizes a limited amount of labeled nodes to enhance the performance of unsupervised GAD. Extensive experiments on ten datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CLAD in comparison to existing unsupervised GAD methods, even in the absence of ground-truth class label information.

Here, we propose scFP (single-cell Feature Propagation), which directly propagates features, i.e., gene expression, especially in raw feature space, via cell-cell graph. Specifically, it first obtains a warmed-up cell-gene matrix via Hard Feature Propagation which fully utilizes known gene transcripts. Then, we refine the k-Nearest Neighbor(kNN) of the cell-cell graph with a warmed-up cell-gene matrix, followed by Soft Feature Propagation which now allows known gene transcripts to be further denoised through their neighbors.

            "abstract": "Recent works demonstrate that GNN models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which refer to imperceptible perturbation on the graph structure and node features. Among various GNN models, graph contrastive learning (GCL) based methods specifically suffer from adversarial attacks due to their inherent design that highly depends on the self-supervision signals derived from the original graph, which however already contains noise when the graph is attacked. To achieve adversarial robustness against such attacks, existing methods adopt adversarial training (AT) to the GCL framework, which considers the attacked graph as an augmentation under the GCL framework. However, we find that existing adversarially trained GCL methods achieve robustness at the expense of not being able to preserve the node feature similarity. In this paper, we propose a similarity-preserving adversarial graph contrastive learning (SP-AGCL) framework that contrasts the clean graph with two auxiliary views of different properties (i.e., the node similarity-preserving view and the adversarial view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SP-AGCL achieves a competitive performance on several downstream tasks, and shows its effectiveness in various scenarios, e.g., a network with adversarial attacks,noisy labels, and heterophilous neighbors.

            "abstract": "User modeling, which learns to represent users into a low-dimensional representation space based on their past behaviors, got a surge of interest from the industry for providing personalized services to users. Previous efforts in user modeling mainly focus on learning a task-specific user representation that is designed for a single task. However, since learning task-specific user representations for every task is infeasible, recent studies introduce the concept of universal user representation, which is a more generalized representation of a user that is relevant to a variety of tasks. Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches for learning universal user representations are impractical in real-world applications due to the data requirement, catastrophic forgetting and the limited learning capability for continually added tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel continual user representation learning method, called TERACON, whose learning capability is not limited as the number of learned tasks increases while capturing the relationship between the tasks. The main idea is to introduce an embedding for each task, i.e., task embedding, which is utilized to generate task-specific soft masks that not only allow the entire model parameters to be updated until the end of training sequence, but also facilitate the relationship between the tasks to be captured. Moreover, we introduce a novel knowledge retention module with pseudo-labeling strategy that successfully alleviates the long-standing problem of continual learning, i.e., catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on public and proprietary real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and practicality of TERACON. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sein-Kim/TERACON.",

            "abstract": "Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in node classification tasks, their performance heavily relies on the availability of a sufficient number of labeled nodes per class. In real-world situations, not all classes have many labeled nodes and there may be instances where the model needs to classify new classes, making manual labeling difficult. To solve this problem, it is important for GNNs to be able to classify nodes with a limited number of labeled nodes, known as few-shot node classification. Previous episodic meta-learning based methods have demonstrated success in few-shot node classification, but our findings suggest that optimal performance can only be achieved with a substantial amount of diverse training meta-tasks. To address this challenge of meta-learning based few-shot learning (FSL), we propose a new approach, the Task-Equivariant Graph few-shot learning (TEG) framework. Our TEG framework enables the model to learn transferable task-adaptation strategies using a limited number of training meta-tasks, allowing it to acquire meta-knowledge for a wide range of meta-tasks. By incorporating equivariant neural networks, TEG can utilize their strong generalization abilities to learn highly adaptable task-specific strategies. As a result, TEG achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training meta-tasks. Our experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate TEG's superiority in terms of accuracy and generalization ability, even when using minimal meta-training data, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing the challenges of meta-learning based few-shot node classification.

Doing so enables full utilization of the information of all nodes in a graph, which is not possible in current supervised meta-learning methods for FSNC due to the label-scarcity problem. In addition, unlike unsupervised Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) methods that overlook the downstream task to be solved at the training phase resulting in vulnerability to class imbalance of a graph, we adopt the episodic learning framework that allows the model to be aware of the downstream task format, i.e., FSNC. The proposed NaQ is a simple but effective unsupervised episode generation method that randomly samples nodes from a graph to make a support set, followed by similarity-based sampling of nodes to make the corresponding query set. Since NaQ is model-agnostic, any existing supervised graph meta-learning methods can be trained in an unsupervised manner, while not sacrificing much of their performance or sometimes even improving them. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed unsupervised episode generation method for graph meta-learning towards the FSNC task.

We argue that our proposed method mimics the nature of chemical reactions, i.e., the core substructure of a molecule varies depending on which other molecule it interacts with.

            "abstract": "Recommender systems have become indispensable in music streaming services, enhancing user experiences by personalizing playlists and facilitating the serendipitous discovery of new music. However, the existing recommender systems overlook the unique challenges inherent in the music domain, specifically shuffle play, which provides subsequent tracks in a random sequence. Based on our observation that the shuffle play sessions hinder the overall training process of music recommender systems mainly due to the high unique transition rates of shuffle play sessions, we propose a Music Recommender System with Shuffle Play Recommendation Enhancement (MUSE). MUSE employs the self-supervised learning framework that maximizes the agreement between the original session and the augmented session, which is augmented by our novel session augmentation method, called transition-based augmentation. To further facilitate the alignment of the representations between the two views, we devise two fine-grained matching strategies, i.e., item- and similarity-based matching strategies. Through rigorous experiments conducted across diverse environments, we demonstrate MUSE's efficacy over 12 baseline models on a large-scale Music Streaming Sessions Dataset (MSSD) from Spotify. The source code of MUSE is available at https://github.com/yunhak0/MUSE.",
