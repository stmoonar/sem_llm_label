            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "The increasing volumes of data produced by high-throughput instruments coupled with advanced computational infrastructures for scientific computing have enabled what is often called a Fourth Paradigm for scientific research based on the exploration of large datasets. Current scientific research is often interdisciplinary, making data integration a critical technique for combining data from different scientific domains. Research data management is a critical part of this paradigm, through the proposition and development of methods, techniques, and practices for managing scientific data through their life cycle. Research on microbial communities follows the same pattern of production of large amounts of data obtained, for instance, from sequencing organisms present in environmental samples. Data on microbial communities can come from a multitude of sources and can be stored in different formats. For example, data from metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and biological imaging are often combined in studies. In this article, we describe the design and current state of implementation of an integrative research data management framework for the Cluster of Excellence Balance of the Microverse aiming to allow for data on microbial communities to be more easily discovered, accessed, combined, and reused. This framework is based on research data repositories and best practices for managing workflows used in the analysis of microbial communities, which includes recording provenance information for tracking data derivation.",

            "abstract": "Reproducibility is a topic that has received significant attention in recent years. Despite being considered a fundamental factor in the scientific process, recent surveys have shown the difficulty of reproducing already published works, which impacts scientists\u2019 ability to verify, validate, and reuse research findings. Recording provenance data is one of the approaches that can help to mitigate the challenges involved in the reproducibility process. When semantically well defined, provenance can describe the entire process involved in producing a given result. Additionally, the use of semantic web technologies can allow for the provenance data to be machine-actionable. With a focus on computational experiments, this work presents a package for collecting and describing provenance data from R scripts using the REPRODUCE-ME ontology to describe the path taken to produce results. We describe the package implementation process and demonstrate how it can help describe the story of experiments defined as R scripts to support reproducibility.",

            "abstract": "The unprecedented size of the human population, along with its associated economic activities, has an ever\u2010increasing impact on global environments. Across the world, countries are concerned about the growing resource consumption and the capacity of ecosystems to provide resources. To effectively conserve biodiversity, it is essential to make indicators and knowledge openly available to decision\u2010makers in ways that they can effectively use them. The development and deployment of tools and techniques to generate these indicators require having access to trustworthy data from biological collections, field surveys and automated sensors, molecular data, and historic academic literature. The transformation of these raw data into synthesized information that is fit for use requires going through many refinement steps. The methodologies and techniques applied to manage and analyze these data constitute an area usually called biodiversity informatics. Biodiversity data follow a life cycle consisting of planning, collection, certification, description, preservation, discovery, integration, and analysis. Researchers, whether producers or consumers of biodiversity data, will likely perform activities related to at least one of these steps. This article explores each stage of the life cycle of biodiversity data, discussing its methodologies, tools, and challenges.",

We introduce BioinfoPortal, a science gateway that integrates a suite of different bioinformatics applications using HPC and data management resources provided by the Brazilian National HPC System (SINAPAD). BioinfoPortal follows the Software as a Service (SaaS) model and the web server is freely available for academic use. The goal of this paper is to describe the science gateway and its usage, addressing challenges of designing a multiuser computational platform for parallel/distributed executions of large-scale bioinformatics applications using the Brazilian HPC resources. We also present a study of performance and scalability of some bioinformatics applications executed in the HPC environments and perform machine learning analyses for predicting features for the HPC allocation/usage that could better perform the bioinformatics applications via BioinfoPortal",

            "abstract": "The unprecedented size of the human population, along with its associated economic activities, have an ever increasing impact on global environments. Across the world, countries are concerned about the growing resource consumption and the capacity of ecosystems to provide them. To effectively conserve biodiversity, it is essential to make indicators and knowledge openly available to decision-makers in ways that they can effectively use them. The development and deployment of mechanisms to produce these indicators depend on having access to trustworthy data from field surveys and automated sensors, biological collections, molecular data, and historic academic literature. The transformation of this raw data into synthesized information that is fit for use requires going through many refinement steps. The methodologies and techniques used to manage and analyze this data comprise an area often called biodiversity informatics (or e-Biodiversity). Biodiversity data follows a life cycle consisting of planning, collection, certification, description, preservation, discovery, integration, and analysis. Researchers, whether producers or consumers of biodiversity data, will likely perform activities related to at least one of these steps. This article explores each stage of the life cycle of biodiversity data, discussing its methodologies, tools, and challenges.",

These experiments usually demand high performance computation and produce huge quantities of data. They also require different programs to be executed in a certain order, allowing the experiments to be modeled as workflows. However, users do not always have the infrastructure needed to perform these experiments. Our contribution is the integration of scientific workflow management systems and grid-enabled scientific gateways, providing the user with a transparent way to run these workflows in geographically distributed computing resources. The availability of the workflow through the gateway allows for a better usability of these experiments.",

Because these experiments are computation- and data-intensive, they require high-performance computing techniques and can benefit from specialized technologies such as Scientific Workflow Management Systems and databases. In this work, we present BioWorkbench, a framework for managing and analyzing bioinformatics experiments. This framework automatically collects provenance data, including both performance data from workflow execution and data from the scientific domain of the workflow application. Provenance data can be analyzed through a web application that abstracts a set of queries to the provenance database, simplifying access to provenance information. We evaluate BioWorkbench using three case studies: SwiftPhylo, a phylogenetic tree assembly workflow; SwiftGECKO, a comparative genomics workflow; and RASflow, a RASopathy analysis workflow. We analyze each workflow from both computational and scientific domain perspectives, by using queries to a provenance and annotation database. Some of these queries are available as a pre-built feature of the BioWorkbench web application. Through the provenance data, we show that the framework is scalable and achieves high-performance, reducing up to 98% of the case studies execution time. We also show how the application of machine learning techniques can enrich the analysis process.",

A user-friendly web interface, GeNNet-Web, allows for setting parameters, executing, and visualizing the results of GeNNet-Wf executions. To demonstrate the features of GeNNet, we performed case studies with data retrieved from GEO, particularly using a single-factor experiment in different analysis scenarios.
