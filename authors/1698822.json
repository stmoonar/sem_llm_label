            "title": "Supporting Virtual Team Formation through Community-Wide Deliberation",
            "abstract": "Team-based learning is a structured, small-group learning method that has been associated with many positive outcomes in traditional classroom settings. However, relatively little research has focused on how to form and support teams within online learning platforms, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). A number of challenges arise for team formation in voluntary online classes: students may drop out and leave their team, and even if they do persist with the course, the team may not work together effectively. In this paper, we introduce a team-formation strategy that incorporates a deliberation process, where participants hold discussions in preparation for the collaboration task. First, we present a crowdsourced experiment that compares teams that are formed before or after a community deliberation process. Results demonstrate that teams engaging in a larger community deliberative process prior to team formation exhibit better team performance--as measured by team collaboration product quality--than pre-discussion teams. In a second crowdsourced experiment, we further explore the benefits of community-wide processes by automatically assigning teams based on participants' transactive interaction during deliberation. The results demonstrate advantages in terms of team performance for teams formed based on observed interactions during the community-level deliberation, compared to randomly formed teams. Finally, in a case study, we demonstrate how we successfully adapted the team formation strategy for use in a small MOOC.",

            "abstract": "Despite studies showing collaboration to be bene\ufb01cial both in terms of student satisfaction and learning, isolation is the norm in MOOCs. Two problems limiting the success of collaboration in MOOCs are the lack of support for team formation and structured collaboration support. Lack of support and strategies for team formation prevents teams from being set up for success from the beginning. Lack of structured support during synchronous collaboration has been demonstrated to produce signi\ufb01cantly less learning than supported collaboration. This paper describes a deliberation based team formation approach and a scripted collaboration framework for MOOCs aimed at addressing these problems under the um-brella of DANCE 1 whose overarching focus is the enhancement of team-based MOOCs. These two examples of current work have been used as illustrations of insights informing interventions in MOOCs.",

            "abstract": "To create a satisfying social learning experience, an emerging challenge in educational data mining is to automatically assign students into e \u21b5 ective learning teams. In this paper, we utilize discourse data mining as the foundation for an online team-formation procedure. The procedure features a deliberation process prior to team assignment, where participants hold discussions both to prepare for the collaboration task and provide indicators that are then used during automated team assignment. We automatically assign teams in a way that maximizes average observed pairwise transactivity exchange within teams, whereas in a control condition, teams are assigned randomly. We validate our team-formation procedure in a crowdsourced online environment that enables e \u21b5 ective isolation of variables, namely Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk. We compare group knowledge integration outcomes between the two team assignment conditions. Our re-sults demonstrate that transactivity-based team assignment is associated with signi\ufb01cantly greater knowledge integration ( p < . 05, e \u21b5 ect size 3 standard deviations).",

            "abstract": "With the aim of better scaffolding discussion to improve learning in a MOOC context, this work investigates what kinds of discussion behaviors contribute to learning. We explored whether engaging in higher-order thinking behaviors results in more learning than paying general or focused attention to course materials. In order to evaluate whether to attribute the effect to engagement in the associated behaviors versus persistent characteristics of the students, we adopted two approaches. First, we used propensity score matching to pair students who exhibit a similar level of involvement in other course activities. Second, we explored individual variation in engagement in higher-order thinking behaviors across weeks. The results of both analyses support the attribution of the effect to the behavioral interpretation. A further analysis using LDA applied to course materials suggests that more social oriented topics triggered richer discussion than more biopsychology oriented topics.",

In contrast, work in learning analytics attempts to leverage the collection and analysis of data to improve learning processes and outcomes in-situ.

Efforts in this direction are specifically promising in support of students\u2019 selfand socially sharedregulation of their learning. Data on collaborative and metacognitive activities can inform collaborating groups and help them to improve future joint efforts.

To do this, we take a multimodal approach\u2014we propose a robust nonparanormal model to learn the stochastic dependencies among the image, the candidate descriptions, and the popular votes.

            "abstract": "Online discussion forums are complex webs of overlapping subcommunities (macrolevel structure, across threads) in which users enact different roles depending on which subcommunity they are participating in within a particular time point (microlevel structure, within threads). This sub-network structure is implicit in massive collections of threads. To uncover this structure, we develop a scalable algorithm based on stochastic variational inference and leverage topic models (LDA) along with mixed membership stochastic block (MMSB) models. We evaluate our model on three large-scale datasets, Cancer-ThreadStarter (22K users and 14.4K threads), Cancer-NameMention(15.1K users and 12.4K threads) and StackOverFlow (1.19 million users and 4.55 million threads). Qualitatively, we demonstrate that our model can provide useful explanations of microlevel and macrolevel user presentation characteristics in different communities using the topics discovered from posts. Quantitatively, we show that our model does better than MMSB and LDA in predicting user reply structure within threads. In addition, we demonstrate via synthetic data experiments that the proposed active sub-network discovery model is stable and recovers the original parameters of the experimental setup with high probability.",

CAH systems support people\u2019s natural desire to be funny by helping them express their own idiosyncratic sense of humor. Artificial intelligence research has tried for years to create systems that are funny, but found the problem to be extremely hard. We show that by combining the strengths of a computer and a human, CAH can foster humor better than either alone. We present CAHOOTS, an online chat system that suggests humorous images to its users to include in the conversation. We compare CAHOOTS to a regular chat system, and to a system that automatically inserts funny images using an artificial humor-bot. Users report that CAHOOTS made their conversations more enjoyable and funny, and helped them to express their personal senses of humor. Computer-Aided Humor offers an example of how systems can algorithmically augment human intelligence to create rich, creative experiences.",

            "abstract": "While MOOCs undoubtedly provide valuable learning resources for students, little research in the MOOC context has sought to evaluate students\u2019 learning gains in the environment. It has been long acknowledged that conversation is a significant way for students to construct knowledge and learn. However, rather than studying learning in MOOC discussion forums, the thrust of current research in that context has been to identify factors that predict dropout. Thus, cognitively relevant student behavior in the forums has not been evaluated for its impact on cognitive processes and learning. In this paper, we adopt a content analysis approach to analyze students\u2019 cognitively relevant behaviors in a MOOC discussion forum and further explore the relationship between the quantity and quality of that participation with their learning gains. As an integral part of our approach, we built a computational model to automate the analysis so that it is possible to extend the content analysis to all communication that occurred in the MOOC. We identified significant associations between discourse behavior and learning. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we model conversational roles in terms of distributions of turn level behaviors, including conversation acts and stylistic markers, as they occur over the whole interaction. This work presents a lightly supervised approach to inducing role definitions over sets of contributions within an extended interaction, where the supervision comes in the form of an outcome measure from the interaction. The identified role definitions enable a mapping from behavior profiles of each participant in an interaction to limited sized feature vectors that can be used effectively to predict the teamwork outcome. An empirical evaluation applied to two Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs) datasets demonstrates that this approach yields superior performance in learning representations for predicting the teamwork outcome over several baselines.",
