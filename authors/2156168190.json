            "title": "MulAxialGO: Multi-Modal Feature-Enhanced Deep Learning Model for Protein Function Prediction",
            "abstract": "Predicting protein function from sequences through machine learning can improve the understanding of novel proteins and biological mechanisms. Existing methods mainly rely on one-dimensional convolution or natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract features from sequences, but they suffer from limited predictive performance. To address this challenge, we propose MulAxialGO, a new method that leverages multi-modal feature fusion to improve prediction accuracy. MulAxialGO integrates the prior features of a large-scale pre-trained protein language model and the posterior features of dynamic embedding coding and sequence homology. In addition, MulAxialGO employs a comprehensive image feature encoder to extract features from sequences, providing a novel perspective for protein function prediction. MulAxialGO is tested on two benchmark datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results. On the 2016 dataset, MulAxialGO significantly outperforms DeepGOPlus, improving molecular function by 4.5 points, biological process by 2.4 points and cellular component by 1.6 points for the AUPR metric. Similarly, on the NetGO dataset, MulAxialGO outperforms the state-of-the-art NetGO2.0, improving Fmax by 1.1 points for biological process and 2.3 points for cellular component.",

            "title": "Learning Task-Aware Effective Brain Connectivity for fMRI Analysis with Graph Neural Networks (Extended Abstract)",
            "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become one of the most common imaging modalities for brain function analysis. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have been adopted for fMRI analysis with superior performance. Unfortunately, traditional functional brain networks are mainly constructed based on similarities among region of interests (ROI), which are noisy and agnostic to the downstream prediction tasks and can lead to inferior results for GNN-based models. To better adapt GNNs for fMRI analysis, we propose TBDS, an end-to-end framework based on Task-aware Brain connectivity DAG (short for Directed Acyclic Graph) Structure generation for fMRI analysis. The key component of TBDS is the brain network generator which adopts a DAG learning approach to transform the raw time-series into task-aware brain connectivities. Besides, we design an additional contrastive regularization to inject task-specific knowledge during the brain network generation process. Comprehensive experiments on two fMRI datasets, namely Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and Philadelphia Neuroimaging Cohort (PNC) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of TBDS. In addition, the generated brain networks also highlight the prediction-related brain regions and thus provide unique interpretations of the prediction results. Our implementation will be published upon acceptance.",
