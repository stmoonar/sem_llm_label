            "abstract": "Deciphering the intricate relationships between transcription factors (TFs), enhancers, and genes through the inference of enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks is crucial in understanding gene regulatory programs in a complex biological system. This study introduces STREAM, a novel method that leverages a Steiner Forest Problem model, a hybrid biclustering pipeline, and submodular optimization to infer enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks from jointly profiled single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data. Compared to existing methods, STREAM demonstrates enhanced performance in terms of TF recovery, TF-enhancer relation prediction, and enhancer-gene discovery. Application of STREAM to an Alzheimer\u2019s disease dataset and a diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma dataset reveals its ability to identify TF-enhancer-gene relationships associated with pseudotime, as well as key TF-enhancer-gene relationships and TF cooperation underlying tumor cells.",

            "abstract": "Cis-regulatory motif finding is a crucial step in the detection of gene regulatory mechanisms using genomic data. Deep learning (DL) models have been utilized to denovoly identify motifs, and have been proven to outperform traditional methods. By 2020, twenty DL models have been developed to identify DNA and RNA motifs with diverse framework designs and implementation styles. Hence, it is beneficial to systematically compare their performances, which can facilitate researchers in selecting the appropriate tools for their motif analyses. Here, we carried out an in-depth assessment of the 20 models utilizing 1,043 genomic sequencing datasets, including 690 ENCODE ChIP-Seq, 126 cancer ChIP-Seq, 172 single-cell cleavages under targets and release using a nuclease, and 55 RNA CLIP-Seq. Four metrics were designed and investigated, including the accuracy of motif finding, the performance of DNA/RNA sequence classification, algorithm scalability, and tool usability. The assessment results demonstrated the high complementarity of the existing models, and it was determined that the most suitable model should primarily depend on the data size and type as well as the model outputs. A webserver was developed to allow efficient access of the identified motifs and effective utilization of high-performing DL models.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in multiple biological processes. However, only a few ncRNAs\u2019 functions have been well studied. Given the significance of ncRNAs classification for understanding ncRNAs\u2019 functions, more and more computational methods have been introduced to improve the classification automatically and accurately. In this paper, based on a convolutional neural network and a deep forest algorithm, multi-grained cascade forest (GcForest), we propose a novel deep fusion learning framework, GcForest fusion method (GCFM), to classify alignments of ncRNA sequences for accurate clustering of ncRNAs. GCFM integrates a multi-view structure feature representation including sequence-structure alignment encoding, structure image representation and shape alignment encoding of structural subunits, enabling us to capture the potential specificity between ncRNAs. For the classification of pairwise alignment of two ncRNA sequences, the F-value of GCFM improves 6% than an existing alignment-based method. Furthermore, the clustering of ncRNA families is carried out based on the classification matrix generated from GCFM. Results suggest better performance (with 20% accuracy improved) than existing ncRNA clustering methods (RNAclust, Ensembleclust and CNNclust). Additionally, we apply GCFM to construct a phylogenetic tree of ncRNA and predict the probability of interactions between RNAs. Most ncRNAs are located correctly in the phylogenetic tree, and the prediction accuracy of RNA interaction is 90.63%. A web server (http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/gcfm/) is developed to maximize its availability, and the source code and related data are available at the same URL.",

            "abstract": "Abstract A group of genes controlled as a unit, usually by the same repressor or activator gene, is known as a regulon. The ability to identify active regulons within a specific cell type, i.e., cell-type-specific regulons (CTSR), provides an extraordinary opportunity to pinpoint crucial regulators and target genes responsible for complex diseases. However, the identification of CTSRs from single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data is computationally challenging. We introduce IRIS3, the first-of-its-kind web server for CTSR inference from scRNA-Seq data for human and mouse. IRIS3 is an easy-to-use server empowered by over 20 functionalities to support comprehensive interpretations and graphical visualizations of identified CTSRs. CTSR data can be used to reliably characterize and distinguish the corresponding cell type from others and can be combined with other computational or experimental analyses for biomedical studies. CTSRs can, therefore, aid in the discovery of major regulatory mechanisms and allow reliable constructions of global transcriptional regulation networks encoded in a specific cell type. The broader impact of IRIS3 includes, but is not limited to, investigation of complex diseases hierarchies and heterogeneity, causal gene regulatory network construction, and drug development. IRIS3 is freely accessible from https://bmbl.bmi.osumc.edu/iris3/ with no login requirement.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The identification of transcription factor binding sites and cis-regulatory motifs is a frontier whereupon the rules governing protein\u2013DNA binding are being revealed. Here, we developed a new method (DEep Sequence and Shape mOtif or DESSO) for cis-regulatory motif prediction using deep neural networks and the binomial distribution model. DESSO outperformed existing tools, including DeepBind, in predicting motifs in 690 human ENCODE ChIP-sequencing datasets. Furthermore, the deep-learning framework of DESSO expanded motif discovery beyond the state-of-the-art by allowing the identification of known and new protein\u2013protein\u2013DNA tethering interactions in human transcription factors (TFs). Specifically, 61 putative tethering interactions were identified among the 100 TFs expressed in the K562 cell line. In this work, the power of DESSO was further expanded by integrating the detection of DNA shape features. We found that shape information has strong predictive power for TF\u2013DNA binding and provides new putative shape motif information for human TFs. Thus, DESSO improves in the identification and structural analysis of TF binding sites, by integrating the complexities of DNA binding into a deep-learning framework.",

However, existing methods do not adequately address a comprehensive detection of all significant bicluster structures and have limited power when applied to expression data generated by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq), especially single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data, where massive zero and low expression values are observed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe present a new biclustering algorithm, QUalitative BIClustering algorithm Version 2 (QUBIC2), which is empowered by: (i) a novel left-truncated mixture of Gaussian model for an accurate assessment of multimodality in zero-enriched expression data, (ii) a fast and efficient dropouts-saving expansion strategy for functional gene modules optimization using information divergency, and (iii) a rigorous statistical test for the significance of all the identified biclusters in any organism, including those without substantial functional annotations. QUBIC2 demonstrated considerably improved performance in detecting biclusters compared to other five widely-used algorithms on various benchmark datasets from E. coli, Human, and simulated data. QUBIC2 also showcased robust and superior performance on gene expression data generated by microarray, bulk RNA-Seq, and scRNA-Seq.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe source code of QUBIC2 is freely available at https://github.com/OSU-BMBL/QUBIC2.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

            "abstract": "Next-Generation Sequencing has made available substantial amounts of large-scale Omics data, providing unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological systems. Specifically, the value of RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data has been confirmed in inferring how gene regulatory systems will respond under various conditions (bulk data) or cell types (single-cell data). RNA-Seq can generate genome-scale gene expression profiles that can be further analyzed using correlation analysis, co-expression analysis, clustering, differential gene expression (DGE), among many other studies. While these analyses can provide invaluable information related to gene expression, integration and interpretation of the results can prove challenging. Here we present a tool called IRIS-EDA, which is a Shiny web server for expression data analysis. It provides a straightforward and user-friendly platform for performing numerous computational analyses on user-provided RNA-Seq or Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. Specifically, three commonly used R packages (edgeR, DESeq2, and limma) are implemented in the DGE analysis with seven unique experimental design functionalities, including a user-specified design matrix option. Seven discovery-driven methods and tools (correlation analysis, heatmap, clustering, biclustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)) are provided for gene expression exploration which is useful for designing experimental hypotheses and determining key factors for comprehensive DGE analysis. Furthermore, this platform integrates seven visualization tools in a highly interactive manner, for improved interpretation of the analyses. It is noteworthy that, for the first time, IRIS-EDA provides a framework to expedite submission of data and results to NCBI\u2019s Gene Expression Omnibus following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) Data Principles.

            "title": "A New Machine Learning-Based Framework for Mapping Uncertainty Analysis in RNA-Seq Read Alignment and Gene Expression Estimation",
            "abstract": "One of the main benefits of using modern RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology is the more accurate gene expression estimations compared with previous generations of expression data, such as the microarray. However, numerous issues can result in the possibility that an RNA-Seq read can be mapped to multiple locations on the reference genome with the same alignment scores, which occurs in plant, animal, and metagenome samples. Such a read is so-called a multiple-mapping read (MMR). The impact of these MMRs is reflected in gene expression estimation and all downstream analyses, including differential gene expression, functional enrichment, etc. Current analysis pipelines lack the tools to effectively test the reliability of gene expression estimations, thus are incapable of ensuring the validity of all downstream analyses. Our investigation into 95 RNA-Seq datasets from seven plant and animal species (totaling 1,951 GB) indicates an average of roughly 22% of all reads are MMRs. Here we present a machine learning-based tool called GeneQC (Gene expression Quality Control), which can accurately estimate the reliability of each gene's expression level derived from an RNA-Seq dataset. The underlying algorithm is designed based on extracted genomic and transcriptomic features, which are then combined using elastic-net regularization and mixture model fitting to provide a clearer picture of mapping uncertainty for each gene. GeneQC allows researchers to determine reliable expression estimations and conduct further analysis on the gene expression that is of sufficient quality. This tool also enables researchers to investigate continued re-alignment methods to determine more accurate gene expression estimates for those with low reliability. Application of GeneQC reveals high level of mapping uncertainty in plant samples and limited, severe mapping uncertainty in animal samples.

            "abstract": "Abstract Discovering new long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been a fundamental step in lncRNA-related research. Nowadays, many machine learning-based tools have been developed for lncRNA identification. However, many methods predict lncRNAs using sequence-derived features alone, which tend to display unstable performances on different species. Moreover, the majority of tools cannot be re-trained or tailored by users and neither can the features be customized or integrated to meet researchers\u2019 requirements. In this study, features extracted from sequence-intrinsic composition, secondary structure and physicochemical property are comprehensively reviewed and evaluated. An integrated platform named LncFinder is also developed to enhance the performance and promote the research of lncRNA identification. LncFinder includes a novel lncRNA predictor using the heterologous features we designed. Experimental results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art tools on multiple species with more robust and satisfactory results. Researchers can additionally employ LncFinder to extract various classic features, build classifier with numerous machine learning algorithms and evaluate classifier performance effectively and efficiently. LncFinder can reveal the properties of lncRNA and mRNA from various perspectives and further inspire lncRNA\u2013protein interaction prediction and lncRNA evolution analysis. It is anticipated that LncFinder can significantly facilitate lncRNA-related research, especially for the poorly explored species. LncFinder is released as R package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=LncFinder). A web server (http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/lncfinder/) is also developed to maximize its availability.",
